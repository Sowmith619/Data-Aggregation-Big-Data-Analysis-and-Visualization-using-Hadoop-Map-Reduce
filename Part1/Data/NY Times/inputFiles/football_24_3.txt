            At 80, the legendary playwright reflects on his forward-looking art.
           By Philip GalanesPortrait by Todd HidoScene Photographs by Bon Duke  APRIL 10, 2019At first glance, the early life and career of Terrence McNally seems suspiciously charmed: Just a year after graduating from Columbia University in 1960,1 he was hired by John Steinbeck and his wife as a tutor for their two teenage sons on a yearlong family trip around the world.2 By then, McNally was already in a relationship with his first lover, the playwright Edward Albee, who was a decade older.3 Even a warning about McNally’s heavy drinking, in 1980, was starry: The actress Angela Lansbury admonished him that he would never reach his potential as a writer if he continued drinking — at a birthday party for Stephen Sondheim, no less.From his Broadway debut as a playwright in 1965,4 at the age of 26, McNally wrote comic plays prolifically and mostly successfully for over two decades. Then something shifted: Nearing 50, newly sober and single, he found a new voice — more probing and dramatic, less dependent on wit — with “Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune,”5 which opened off Broadway in 1987, starring Kathy Bates and F. Murray Abraham. Like much of McNally’s best work, “Frankie and Johnny” explores the longing for human connection and the fears that stand in its way. A new revival, starring Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon, will debut on Broadway in May.McNally followed “Frankie and Johnny” with several well-regarded plays, often focusing on gay men and reflecting his own love of opera, notably “Love! Valour! Compassion!” (1994)6 and “Master Class” (1995),7 both of which won him Tony Awards. In parallel, he wrote librettos for several Broadway musicals, including “Kiss of the Spider Woman” (1993), based on the novel by Manuel Puig, and “Ragtime” (1998), adapted from the 1975 novel by E.L. Doctorow, earning him two more Tonys.What distinguishes all of McNally’s later plays, however, is his canny mix of terror and humor. He probes his characters’ deepest fears — of illness, intimacy, betrayal or death — while making them manageable for all audiences, leavening the dread with his rat-a-tat dialogue and well-timed jokes.8 You can call it fainthearted, but there is generosity and wisdom in his calculus: For decades, McNally has brought both the darkness and light of the human condition to theatergoers who might have avoided the pure despair of his closest predecessors, Eugene O’Neill or Arthur Miller. Like them, though, McNally’s scripts rely on a kind of classic formalism (larger-than-life characters, well-defined conflicts, clear narrative arcs) that has influenced the current era of television — you need only look at “Succession” or “Mad Men” for echoes of McNally’s work: his skill at elevating the tension in stories to nearly unbearable levels before releasing that pressure, suddenly, with unexpected tonal shifts.McNally’s other great legacy might be bringing gayness to a broad theater audience, and in doing so, humanizing and universalizing the specific concerns and sorrows, including AIDS, of the community. He all but coined the expression “love is love” — the third act of “Love! Valour! Compassion!” alone, in which an improbable romance blooms between a character with H.I.V. and another dying of complications from AIDS, would likely draw tears from even the most virulent homophobe. Still, his gift for transforming inherent tragedy into an entertaining evening may have cost him in terms of his critical reputation: McNally is rarely considered to be at the cutting-edge of contemporary playwrights, even though he was among the first to place such marginalized characters at center stage and, too, one of a small group of men at the time who wrote persuasively about the interior lives of women.9 In that way, his work stands for itself — and being produced and nearly endlessly revived for more than 50 years is inarguably its own kind of acclaim.Now 80 — and the author of more than three dozen plays, 14 librettos for musical theater and opera as well as several adaptations of his work for film and television — McNally is still writing. We met in March at his Greenwich Village apartment, where he lives with his husband, the theater producer Tom Kirdahy, for a discussion of his life, his career and his argument for becoming a playwright in the age of prestige television.Starring: (from left) Christy Altomare as SECOND SOPRANO (SHARON); David Hyde Pierce as ACCOMPANIST (MANNY); Vanessa Williams as MARIA CALLAS.MARIA Do you believe women can have balls, Sharon?SHARON Some women.

PHILIP GALANES: In an essay about your childhood,10 you wrote: “I had a very strong desire to make myself heard.” Do you know who writes that? Someone who hasn’t been heard.TERRENCE McNALLY: Maybe the better word is mattered. I wanted to write things that mattered. I wanted to matter. I felt so unnoticed growing up.11 I remember my father going to work, early in the morning, and the dining room table would be covered with mock copy for El Tejano, the school newspaper, which I wrote a lot of and copy-edited. I measured the columns and made them fit. But he didn’t seem impressed that I’d been up all night.PG: Tell me about your family dynamic.TM: Now that I’m older, I think I somewhat terrified my parents. They left me alone. They weren’t unfeeling, more like: We don’t know what he’s doing in his room — writing all the time or listening to Broadway shows and operas.12 We have a weird child. They didn’t get me. And they didn’t particularly want to get me.PG: I think part of my parents’ remoteness was their dawning sense that I was gay.TM: We never discussed it, but that was probably true of mine, too. My parents’ marriage was not without strain. I come from a family of heavy drinkers, so that was an aspect of growing up. But I mainly felt left alone, not blockaded. They were the original “don’t ask, don’t tell.”They could be quite charming, too. One year, [the Italian conductor Arturo] Toscanini was conducting “Aida,” and the best radio in the house was with the TV. Remember consoles — a TV and record player in a beautiful cabinet? So my parents sat in the car, listening to the football game, and let me be in the house, listening. I think that’s more love than saying “I love you.” I remember them out there in their coats; it can get cold in South Texas in the winter.PG: Were you always planning to become a playwright as opposed to, say, a novelist?TM: I realized very early that my descriptive powers — what a room looked like, what a person looked like — were scant. But I could write credible dialogue. And my characters sounded different from one another. I could define them better by how they spoke than by telling you how they looked. And after college, when I went to Mexico and wrote half of my Great American Novel, I decided if I really wanted to be a writer, I’d better focus on theater.PG: Well, you’ve definitely been heard as a playwright. Does that desire to matter ever go away?TM: No, I don’t think it does.PG: I reread some of your early plays, and as your work matures, it becomes harder to know what you make of your characters and their situations. The man who wants to be heard is gone. Was that intentional?TM: You’re right. I noticed it, too, in hindsight. It was not deliberate. The first play I wrote after I got sober was “Frankie and Johnny.” It was the first play where I’m not writing my opinion of everybody. My early work13 is more satirical, so you know who’s bad; you know my politics. You know what I approve of and what I don’t.So, there was sobriety. I remember how terrified I was, writing “Frankie and Johnny,” being sober for the first time. I just drank too much, alcoholic or not. I was drunk every day. And maybe there was maturity, too? But there was certainly a change in my work. It’s hard to know who you are if you’re drunk all the time. It clouds your thinking. I started thinking more about my people — my characters.PG: Who were your strongest mentors and influences?TM: I’m always reading and rereading Chekhov and Shakespeare. They’re my constant sources of inspiration. They’re not on the page, either. I don’t know what Shakespeare thinks of his characters. And Chekhov plays are totally mysterious. What are they really about?PG: Was Edward Albee, your lover in the late ’50s and early ’60s, helpful to you?TM: No, Edward was very supportive of the next generation of writers, but he found it difficult to be as generous with me.PG: Because he was competitive?TM: Well, it seems absurd that the author of “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” would be competitive with someone trying to write his first play. But I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining. Edward had his limitations. We all do.PG: That yearning to connect at the heart of “Frankie and Johnny” had appeared in your work before, but never so urgently. The idea of a one-night stand who won’t go away, who wants to marry you in the morning — it’s very extreme!TM: It’s a poetic play, poetic and very personal. Most of the plays I’ve written, I think: “No one’s going to want to do this, but I want to tell the story anyway.” I was living in Chelsea, and I saw all these attractive men and women at Blockbuster Video with stacks of tapes. They were clearly going to spend the weekend watching movies at home rather than going out to bars or clubs. And I thought, “How sad! They’ve given up.”I was nearly 50, and I wasn’t in a relationship. I thought, “Maybe it’s all over?” But then I changed my mind. I thought, “I don’t want to imagine a world where being 50 and not looking like a Greek Adonis or Marilyn Monroe means your life is over.” And of course, most of us don’t look like Adonis or Marilyn Monroe, so it turned out there was a huge audience for the play. We dismiss people so quickly: She’s not the one. My favorite line is when Johnny says, “Everything I want is in this room.” I believe that.PG: It’s a remarkably prescient play, with Blockbuster Video morphing into social media and our obsession with cellphones, where nothing we want is in this room.TM: At 80, I’ve certainly lived. And I can say I’ve seen some big changes in my lifetime. But that phenomenon of six people at a restaurant all on their phones! Why did you bother to say, “Let’s have dinner together”? But it just makes you sound like an old grump. And I’m not.PG: No, you were a pioneer, one of the first playwrights to explore gay characters in your work — from the very beginning, in the 1960s. Did you see that as bravery?TM: Not at all. I saw it as: These are people. I wasn’t writing these plays in Texas. I was writing them in New York, which is sophisticated. I always felt it was O.K. to be gay in the American theater. And I never understood my friends who stayed closeted.PG: Maybe coming out required a special temperament when you did, in the late ’50s?TM: It required the temperament to say, “This is who I am. I want to be Terrence McNally.” There’s a line in “Master Class” where one of the students says, “You just want us to sing like you.” And Callas responds, “Only Cecilia Sophia” — and she gives all five of her names — “Kalogeropoulou could sing like Maria Callas.” You had to have had her life to sing like her: the unloving mother, the suffering during the war, the betrayal and struggles.And my life has made me who I am. So, I didn’t think of writing as a gay man as brave. I respected the playwrights and artists who chose to remain closeted, but it angered me. I thought it was morally wrong not to stand up and say, “Hey, I’m one of them.”PG: There’s a leitmotif running through your work, starting with “The Lisbon Traviata,”14 about gay men submerging their deepest emotional lives in Broadway musicals and opera divas.TM: When I came along, gay men were often represented as witty and a little sad. And it’s easier to hide out in the world of Bette Midler or Judy Garland, now Lady Gaga, than really deal with our own lives. But I thought, “Gay men are filled with emotion.” In “The Lisbon Traviata,” I wanted to write a play about a gay man whose passions make him capable of murder — not that I approve of murder.People think gay — no, people thought, I do see change — that gay men and women were somehow “people lite” because we didn’t have the responsibility of families or children. The idea that a gay person can’t have the authentic emotions of a heterosexual — that drove me insane! So, gay anger, loss, grief and rage run through a lot of my plays.PG: What do you think of the labels “gay writer” or “gay play,” now that the nation is circling back to identity politics?TM: No one has asked me that question in years, thank God! I’m a playwright. I think the era when we need to categorize people is over. I went from always being “the gay playwright Terrence McNally” to just being Terrence McNally. I’m glad to have been alive to see that happen. It was always honorable to be a gay man and a gay writer. But I think categorizing people that way marginalizes them.Starring: (from left) Katie Finneran as SALLY; Michael Shannon as SAM; Donna Murphy as CHLOE; and Brian Stokes Mitchell as JOHN.CHLOE Fireworks! A full moon! The ocean! The Fourth of July! Sally, if you don’t keep this house you should have your head examined.(The fireworks are reaching a noisy, colorful climax. JOHN has given everyone a small American flag.)CHLOE Happy Fourth everyone! Vive les États-Unis and the republic for which it stands!SALLY What are we supposed to do?JOHN Just wave your flag.SAM I feel like an idiot.CHLOE John, remind me to remind Little Theater we haven’t done “The Music Man” in ages. (She starts to sing “America the Beautiful.” JOHN and SAM join in lustily. SALLY sings, too, but more quietly. She is crying.) PG: When the AIDS crisis exploded, there were some very moving “issue” plays, like “The Normal Heart” (1985) by Larry Kramer, about gay men dying. But you were ingenious with “Lips Together, Teeth Apart,” flipping the script and writing about AIDS from the vantage of two straight couples, after the gay man, a brother of one of the women, has died.TM: Gay people, like people in all minority communities, are often being observed by the majority. So, I imagined these four straight people, surrounded by all these houses, suddenly in the minority on Fire Island on this big Fourth of July weekend. They’re the ones being judged. It seemed like the right idea.PG: Was it hard not to judge those characters — refusing to get into the swimming pool, for instance, for fear of catching AIDS?TM: I didn’t need to judge them. Just showing their actions conveyed the foolishness of it, their hysteria. That moment was actually based on a good friend of mine. She said, “Can I have another water glass?” And I replied, “What’s wrong with it?” She said, “I think you took a sip out of my glass.” It was unspoken. And this was a sophisticated woman. Suddenly, my dentist had gloves and masks. It didn’t need to be spoken.Most people think playwriting is writing dialogue. But, actually, it’s observing action. I don’t puzzle out plays: What should I write about next? An idea comes. And in “Lips Together,” I knew I was writing for those four actors.15 I love that! If someone said to me, “Could you write a play in the next two weeks?” and gave me four actors I like and can write for, I could do it. I like imagining the voices. In my early plays, I used to write for Laurence Olivier and Ethel Merman. I could hear Ethel saying my lines.PG: It’s an interesting element of your career, the way you’ve established a company of actors: Nathan Lane,16 Anthony Heald.17 Later, Zoe Caldwell18 and Audra McDonald.19TM: Working with a company of actors who get it, who get you, is incredible. You don’t have to explain. If you have to explain to an actor why a line is funny or poignant, they’re wrong for you. Those actors you mentioned, I’ve never once said, “You know that one line? If you just hit that word harder … ” But those same actors, they’re all stars. They’re too big to be contained. So, they fly away and are often unavailable.PG: That must hurt. You made some of their careers.TM: I used to take it very hard. But at 80, I’m better about it. Oh, a chance to play Hamlet at London’s National Theater? I get it. But that generosity took a while.PG: I gather you’re not an adherent of the Alfred Hitchcock school: Treat actors like cattle?20TM: The hardest part of the job is, and always will be, to get the right actors and the right director in a room together with the right script. That’s the inviolate law of good theater. You want to surround yourself with the best. Especially for a play that’s having its world premiere. You’re making a footprint of it with the actors and designers. And I’ve been very lucky. It’s a wonderful challenge to write for actors like Nathan Lane or Zoe Caldwell. I’ve always said that Shakespeare must have had great actors at the Globe. You don’t write parts like King Lear or Cleopatra unless you have actors who can handle them.PG: How much are you still discovering plays when you take them into rehearsal with the actors and director? I’m thinking of a sprawling play like “Love! Valour! Compassion!” with eight big characters romping through a crowded summer house.TM: That was a play I struggled with. A lot happened to it in rehearsal. But I ended up being very proud of it. I wanted to show what else gay men were doing besides having AIDS and dying. There was life! We were going on nice weekends to the country. I thought of it as writing a gay “Our Town.”21Some plays are fun to write. I loved writing “Master Class.” It’s pretty much the first draft we took to this remote town in Montana.22 They offered to do a reading of my new play, and I talked Zoe Caldwell into it. I said, “Let’s try it out. Because if it’s only of interest to people who care about opera and Maria Callas, no one will produce it.” They loved it, and Zoe was magnificent. And other plays I’ve worked on so hard I can’t believe it, they’ve been completely rejected.PG: Let’s talk about “Master Class.” In Callas’s final speech, we may get as close to you as we do in any play: “The older I get, the less I know, but I am certain that what we do matters. If I didn’t believe that … ” and then she can’t finish the sentence.TM: Because it’s incomprehensible to her. If art doesn’t matter, then she has lived her life in vain and suffered in vain. It’s a moment that means so much to me.PG: We hear an echo of it in the short play “Muses of Fire,” which you wrote for this magazine — with all these famous American playwrights kibitzing in heaven on Inauguration Day after the 2024 election. Bad things may happen, but preventing them was never the point of playwriting.TM: No, it’s about having those pure feelings again, reminding the world that we’re not alone. There is finally a generosity among artists, especially when we get older. When we’re young, New York is a big city with a lot of competition. Everyone wants to be Maria Callas or Leonard Bernstein or Nathan Lane. You’ve got to fight. And the people I know who’ve succeeded in this business are killers — including me, or I wouldn’t have kept it up this long. But being a killer is having the fierce need to matter, to be heard. You don’t have to agree with me, but I want to grab you by the lapel and shake you: “At least you’ve heard what I have to say.”PG: Take me through how your best-known musical, “Ragtime,”23 came together.TM: The producer Garth Drabinsky called and said, “I just acquired the rights to ‘Ragtime,’ as a musical. Are you interested?” I reread it that night. It’s one of my favorite books. And I called him back in the morning: “Absolutely!” But what I wanted to do was to write a synopsis and show it to [the author] E.L. Doctorow. If he didn’t like my concept, I didn’t want to do it. I never saw the film of “Ragtime” (1981), but he was on every TV show saying they’d ruined his book. I didn’t want that to be me. But he approved my treatment.So, then we asked different people to submit ideas for five or six songs, based on my outline. It was all anonymous — on cassette tape. And Drabinsky, Doctorow and I all agreed on Tape 7, which turned out to be by Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty.24PG: I’ve never heard of a process like that.TM: It was my idea. I mean, I auditioned; the actors audition. Why shouldn’t the composer and lyricist?PG: Well, it worked: The production was nominated for 13 Tony Awards. Has the show aged well?TM: It hits about every mark in the world of politics today: immigration, refugees, violence against African-Americans. They just did a very successful production at Pasadena Playhouse. People said to me, “You’ve updated it.” Not a word! It’s like the last time I saw “Corpus Christi” (1998),25 people said to me, “I love the way you updated it to include gay marriage.” But my gay Jesus married two guys 20 years ago. It’s nice when things catch up.Starring: (from left) Gavin Creel as BUZZ; Colman Domingo as GREGORY; Robin De Jesus as RAMON; Michael Urie as PERRY; Micah Stock as ARTHUR; Telly Leung as BOBBY; and Jason Danieley as JOHN/JAMES.GREGORY All right, everyone. This is your five-minute call. This is a dress rehearsal. (BUZZ, BOBBY, ARTHUR, RAMON, and GREGORY will get ready to rehearse the Swan Lake Pas de Cygnes. This time they will put on tutus and toe shoes. They will help each other dress.)RAMON Okay, let’s do it.PG: How about when things don’t need to catch up — when you’re writing in the middle of calamity and crisis, like with H.I.V., for instance, or even the current administration? Does the artist have a special responsibility then?TM: Well, I’m working in an age of calamity, but also in an age of great progressive things happening, too, which I consider joyful. So, there’s both, and I think what’s required is an openness to them. One of the reasons I choose to live in New York City — and have since I was 17 — is that you go out onto the street and there are so many different kinds of people, and every one of them has a story. These are tumultuous, rich times for a writer. All you need is ears and a heart.It’s all in a speech in “A Perfect Ganesh.”26 When the character arrives at the airport in Bombay, she prays to open her heart to India, which is so different from the cloistered life she’s lived among affluent white people in Connecticut: Let me experience fully these people who are so different from me. Let me be part of this fabric. Not disappear into it, not become them, but be with them. My advice to artists is the same as I’d give to someone who wanted to be a better dentist or a better lawyer. Show up, listen, let your heart expand.PG: I want to end by asking you about something Steinbeck said to you when you were a young man: “Don’t become a playwright. It’ll break your heart.”TM: I remember it vividly. I think he meant failing in the theater is a very public humiliation. When a show of mine is not going well, and I’m sitting in the audience, I don’t need a critic to tell me. I can feel it.PG: So, did playwriting break your heart?TM: Plenty of times! But it’s filled my heart, too. And I picked myself up and started all over again several times, which is all you can do in life.PG: Are you still writing?TM: I am.27PG: And still going to the theater eight nights a week?TM: Yes, but I’m napping beforehand now. That’s a new phenomenon. I’m living with cancer, which is challenging. The medications often make me tired. But it’s been 20 years since my diagnosis, so I can’t say I didn’t get value.PG: That’s a big change. The theater has changed a lot, too.TM: The world wants blockbusters now: “Hamilton”s, infinite runs. The theater where “The Phantom of the Opera” plays has been unavailable for about 30 years. Hit shows used to run for two seasons. Ticket prices are much higher. But you know what the biggest change is? I ask people who take tickets in the theater what they get asked the most: “How long is it?” And if they answer: “One act, 90 minutes,” people are happy. Attention spans have gotten shorter since I was writing three-act plays with two intermissions.PG: Has the work of being a playwright changed, too?TM: The biggest change I feel in the nearly 60 years I’ve been doing this is that it’s a much longer time from the day you write “The End” on your first draft to the curtain falling on its opening night. It was never literally true, but in the ’60s, it felt like you finished your play on Friday and went into rehearsal on Monday. Now, it feels like you finish your first draft in 2010; you get a reading in 2011; you revise the play and get another reading in 2012. It takes years to get a play on, as opposed to months. And it’s harder to hold onto your vision of what you wanted to write about in the first place.When I first came to New York, plays went out of town and they were developed in front of paying audiences. Now the workshop is the preferred method for developing a show, and I find them tricky because you’re performing it for friends, nervous producers, everybody wanting to make sure it’s a hit. But nothing teaches you more about your play than an audience who has no financial or emotional interest in it: They squirm in their seats; they don’t come back after intermission. Plays are treated like hothouse flowers now. And the theater is more rough-and-tumble than that.PG: So, is there still an argument for becoming a playwright in the age of Netflix?TM: I believe that people’s nervous systems are more open to emotion in the theater with their fellow human beings. When a play is going well, the audience breathes as one. They stop breathing. They breathe together because they’re getting this from other live people. And that doesn’t happen watching Netflix. You talk during it. The phone rings. People are in the theater for one reason: to hear this story and meet the people in it. That’s a human need. If you want to change minds, write a great editorial for the Op-Ed page. But if you want to get people to feel differently, reach them through the theater.This interview has been edited and condensed. Terrence McNally portrait stylist: Tracey Nicholson.

McNally majored in English but never took a playwriting class. And he spent most of his evenings at the theater, opera or ballet.2. McNally was recommended for the job by Molly Kazan, the playwright and wife of Elia Kazan, the director of “A Streetcar Named Desire” (1947) and “Death of a Salesman” (1949) on Broadway.3. Albee wrote his best-known work, “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1962), during their relationship.4. The play, “And Things That Go Bump in the Night,” was largely panned.5. About two middle-aged people in an Upper West Side apartment, in a hookup’s postcoital throes.6. About eight interconnected gay men in a country house in upstate New York over three summer holiday weekends.7. About the travails of being, and being taught by, the opera diva Maria Callas.8. In “The Lisbon Traviata” (1989), for instance, a literally murderous breakup is interrupted by repeated phone calls from an opera-crazed friend who wants to borrow a record album.9. For example: “Lips Together, Teeth Apart” (1991), in which the character Sally — who is unable to carry her pregnancies to term — is a complex mixture of grief, rage and self-blame.10. Originally published in McNally’s “Selected Works: A Memoir in Plays” (2015).11. McNally, the elder of two sons of a beer distributor and a homemaker, was born in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1938. He had a peripatetic childhood before moving at age 13 to Corpus Christi, Tex.12. His favorites, back then: “The Pajama Game” (1954); “My Fair Lady” (1956); and “Damn Yankees” (1955).13. Including “Next” (1969), an absurdist play about a middle-aged man who is mistakenly called for the Vietnam War draft, and “The Ritz” (1975), a farce about a straight man hiding out from his murderous brother-in-law in a gay bathhouse. 14. A drama about two opera lovers, one of whom is single and obsessed with Maria Callas, and the other, who kills his boyfriend when he tries to leave him.15. The original Off Broadway cast starred Christine Baranski, Anthony Heald, Swoosie Kurtz and Nathan Lane.16. Starred in: “The Lisbon Traviata,” “Lips Together, Teeth Apart” and “Love! Valour! Compassion!”17. Starred in: “The Lisbon Traviata” and “Lips Together, Teeth Apart.”18. Starred in: “A Perfect Ganesh” (1993) and “Master Class.”19. Starred in “Master Class,” “Ragtime” and the 2019 “Frankie and Johnny” revival.20. The director’s notorious quip — “actors are cattle” — was published in The Washington Post in 1940 and quickly spread through Hollywood.21. Thornton Wilder’s 1938 three-act — perhaps America’s most-produced play — that dramatizes the ordinary events in a small U.S. town as a metaphor for cherishing life’s simple pleasures.22. The first out-of-town reading was in Big Fork, Mont., in 1994.23. E.L. Doctorow’s novel concerns three colliding groups (black people, suburban white people and eastern European immigrants) in and around early 20th-century New York.24. A duo responsible for some of America’s most popular musicals, including “Once on This Island” (1990) and “Seussical” (2000).25. A play that imagined, to considerable controversy, a gay Jesus Christ and his apostles living in modern-day Texas. It was restaged at New York’s Rattlestick Playwrights Theater in 2008.26. About two middle-aged women whose sons have died, and who travel to India to find peace.27. His next play, “Immortal Longings,” a reworked version of 2018’s “Fire and Air” (about the Ballets Russes, Sergei Diaghilev’s early 20th-century ballet company) will begin performances in June at the Zach Theater in Austin, Tex.Advertisement
