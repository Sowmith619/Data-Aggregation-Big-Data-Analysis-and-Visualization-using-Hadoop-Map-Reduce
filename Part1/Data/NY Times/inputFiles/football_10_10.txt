I am not receiving any treatment. I want to enjoy my work," explained the 63-year-old coach, in charge until the end of the season at the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan.The football world was quick to offer its support to Caparros."In this game against cancer you will not fight with just 11 players, you have us at your disposition too," former Sevilla coach Michel Gonzalez said on Twitter."This illness doesn't know who it's up against, an insatiable fighter."Other La Liga clubs, including Real Betis, Valencia and Athletic Bilbao sent the coach messages of support.BENZEMA RISES ABOVEReal Madrid's season has largely been a torturous affair but one player has risen head and shoulders above the rest, staking his case to head Zinedine Zidane's new project next season.Karim Benzema is in the form of his career and while Los Blancos struggled against Eibar on Saturday, the Frenchman was at his vibrant best.Benzema had two goals disallowed and hit the woodwork, but scored two more which did count to earn Madrid three points and deny Eibar a first win at the Santiago Bernabeu.Madrid will make big changes in the close season but Benzema has proven he is capable of leading the line.THE GETAFE GRINDIf Getafe reach the Champions League next season it will be a remarkable achievement for the tiny club based in Madrid's suburbs.However, the football world can consider itself warned - they won't necessarily be fun to watch.They eked out a 1-0 win over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday to consolidate their position in fourth.Jose Bordalas's side play with little flair but are extremely well-drilled and are grinding their way towards Europe.
