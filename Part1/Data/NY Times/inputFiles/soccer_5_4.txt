Milan were given a one-season ban from European football in June after UEFA ruled that the club had not complied with FFP rules for the previous monitoring period.Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) which overturned the ban in July, accepting the club’s argument that its finances had improved after an ownership change. Milan were then able to take part in this season's Europa League, which they exited in the group stage, while UEFA was ordered by CAS to find an alternative punishment.In its revised decision in December, UEFA gave Milan until June 2021 to comply with the rules or face a one-season ban from European competition.Milan are currently fourth in Serie A, which is the final Champions League qualifying place for next season's competition.
