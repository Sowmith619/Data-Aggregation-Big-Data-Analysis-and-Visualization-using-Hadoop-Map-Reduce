"We know there are many decisions that no one knows if VAR is going to be used or not, to check or not."Maybe technically it was a penalty because it was handball, but we do not know the protocol. There are a lot of question marks and a lot of work to do."I think it's going to change the spirit of the game and I'm very worried about how it's going to work next season."Tottenham fans chanted "VAR VAR" shortly after Aguero's penalty miss, when Harry Kane was challenged in the penalty area - a chant that might become a regular refrain at Premier League grounds next season.Even when they celebrated Son Heung-min's 78th-minute winner there was an anxious moment when the validity of the goal was checked by VAR - briefly ruining the spontaneity of the moment, which is an integral part of football."It's going to be a tough summer to try to find the best way to work. Is it going to check everything?" Pochettino said."I don't know because today there were a lot of actions you could check. Next season, how is it going to work? Many things we need to try to make clear."The spirit and the direction of football is going to change. We are going to see a different sport, not the football we grew up watching, that's for sure."
