Huddersfield were eventually relegated last weekend."I have two markets now where I am absolutely ready to compete when the right opportunity comes around the corner," the German told The Times in an interview."The Premier League is the most challenging league in terms of the quality of the clubs, the quality of the managers, the quality of the individuals."The German Bundesliga is very interesting for me because I was born and brought up in Germany. I've never worked in the Bundesliga so that makes it more exciting."Wagner said he would only take up a job which challenged him, one where the club was ready to trust him and his ideas rather than stick to a process they were familiar with."The set-up has to be right, the owner has to be brave enough to try and bring his club forward," Wagner added. "It's all about if the club likes to go into the challenge the way I like to challenge."The mindset has to be exciting and really challenging. If it's a club that only likes to do what they have done before, I don't think this excites (me)."If they like to progress, if someone says, 'OK, this is the fresh air we would like to bring to our football,' then it's not too important if the aim is to leave three teams behind you, challenge for the top ten or try to attack the top six."Wagner previously managed the Borussia Dortmund reserve team before moving to England in 2015.
