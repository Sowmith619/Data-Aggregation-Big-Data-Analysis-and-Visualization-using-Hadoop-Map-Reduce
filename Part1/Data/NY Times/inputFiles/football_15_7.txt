I don't see us slowing down now. Liverpool have a great squad, great self-belief, but so do we," Sterling said.City now face a crucial ten days starting with a home game against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday in their Champions League quarter-final second leg, trailing 1-0 from the opening game.Guardiola's side then play Spurs at the Etihad again, in the league, on Saturday before the Manchester derby at Old Trafford on April 24."The players have shown me they want to do it - I didn't have any doubts about that - and we have taken three points from a very difficult place to win," said Guardiola."We have played with incredible personality in the last two or three months - for the last month we've known that if we drop points it will be more difficult if not impossible to win the title."Of course, Liverpool or we could drop points when you don't expect, and football is unpredictable in that sense," he added."But we don't have any complaints - we have taken 183 points in two seasons and still have five games left. Those are incredible numbers and show how consistent we are." (Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis and Christian Radnedge)Advertisement
