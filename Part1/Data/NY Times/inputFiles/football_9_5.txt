The final is to be played in Argentina.The changes are part of a widespread attempt to revitalize South American club and international competitions and bring them more into line with Europe.CONMEBOL have abandoned their six-decades long tradition of playing the Copa Libertadores final on a home-and-away basis, and will this year play the final at a neutral ground for the first time, much like the Champions League.Next year's Copa America will be the fourth in six years. Officials want the tournament to be played at the same time as the European Championship, Europe's equivalent. (Reporting by Andrew Downie and Daniela Desantis; Editing by Hugh Lawson)Advertisement
