Then Texas Tech grinded past Michigan State 61-51, buoyed by 22 points from Matt Mooney and bolstered by coach Chris Beard's smothering defensive approach.No matter the number of shots made, though, the trophy will be lifted and the confetti will be dropped at U.S. Bank Stadium, where 72,711 fans packed the 3-year-old football facility for the semifinal games on Saturday night.___Advertisement
