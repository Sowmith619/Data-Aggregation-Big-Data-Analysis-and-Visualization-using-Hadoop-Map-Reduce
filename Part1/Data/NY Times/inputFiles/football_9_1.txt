The ban, which ends Costa’s season as there are only seven games remaining, consists of four games for being found in breach of Article 94 of the league’s code of conduct for using insulting or offensive words towards a match official, and four matches for breaching Article 96, which refers to the use of light violence towards referees. Atletico were fined 2800 euros (2,413.70 pounds), while Costa 6010 euros over the incident. They have 10 days in which they can lodge an appeal.
