He is projected to play at running back, the Bills said. Both players will be the 11th man on their teams' practice squads, and 91st on the roster overall, and be retained at least through to the end of their pre-season training camps.Four AFC teams will carry an extra player on their squads this year under the program, which aims to provide hopefuls from around the world to "compete at NFL level, improve their skills, and ultimately earn a spot on an NFL roster".The Miami Dolphins have taken on Brazilian defensive tackle Durval Neto, while German tight end Jakob Johnson, who played at the University of Tennessee, joins the New England Patriots.
