He was then criticized by one of his own teammates, as well as his manager, who blamed him for provoking the taunts.The insults directed at Kean — and the reproach from his teammate and his coach — came only hours after Aleksander Ceferin, the president of UEFA, European soccer’s governing body, had told an equality conference in London that his organization would speak with referees and encourage them “not to be afraid to act” if they heard racist abuse from the crowd.Hours later, in a match in Italy’s Serie A at Cagliari, Kean, a 19-year-old Italian forward of Ivorian descent, and two other black teammates, the French midfielder Blaise Matuidi and the Brazilian defender Alex Sandro, were subjected to consistent racial abuse from Cagliari fans during Juventus’s 2-0 victory.19-year-old Moise Kean strikes AGAIN!He has scored a goal in each of his last four games! pic.twitter.com/2EWBkJZotxWhen Kean, who is enjoying a breakout season with Juventus, scored his team’s second goal to seal the victory, he stood motionless, holding his arms out, in front of the Cagliari fans, prompting yet more abuse. Matuidi, his teammate, was incensed; the Juventus captain, Giorgio Chiellini, protested to the referee, Piero Giacomelli; and Cagliari’s captain, Luca Ceppitelli, asked his team’s fans to stop.After the game, however, the Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci suggested that Kean should shoulder an equal share of the blame because his celebration had antagonized those in Cagliari’s Curva — the end of the stadium where the team’s most ardent fans are housed — who were racially abusing him.“Kean knows that when he scores a goal, he has to focus on celebrating with his teammates,” Bonucci said. “He knows he could have done something differently.“There were racist jeers after the goal. Blaise heard it and was angry. I think the blame is 50-50. Moise should not have done that, and the Curva should not have reacted that way.”Though Massimiliano Allegri, Juventus’s coach, told reporters that nothing justified the behavior of the fans — describing those who had racially abused his players as “idiots” — he, too, suggested that Kean had “provoked” some of the vitriol.“He should not have celebrated in that manner,” said Allegri, a former Cagliari manager. “He is a young man and has to learn, but certain things from the crowd also should not be heard. You need great intelligence to deal with these situations and should not provoke people.“That, of course, does not mean the idiots in the crowd and the way they reacted should be justified.”Allegri insisted that he does not believe halting games is the solution to ending racist abuse, though, because, he said, “not everyone in the stadium” should be punished for the actions of a few.“I don’t think talking about it all the time helps,” he said.Kean posted his own response on his Instragam account: a photo of his silent, arms-out goal celebration and the words, “The best way to respond to racism.”The president of Cagliari, Tommaso Giulini, said Juventus players had told him that Kean was wrong to celebrate in front of the home fans, and he bemoaned all of the “moralizing” over the incident — claiming that there had been no racist abuse until Kean had provoked the fans.“Cagliari rejects the accusations of racism,” he said. “Nothing had happened until the goal. Do not exploit the thing.”A welter of high-profile players moved immediately to support Kean: Raheem Sterling, himself a victim of racist abuse this season, told Bonucci on Instagram that his comments were laughable; Paul Pogba, a former Juventus player, encouraged “good Italians” to “wake up, you can’t let a small racist group speak for you.”The abuse aimed at Kean was only the most recent in a litany of racist incidents in Italian soccer: In December, the Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was abused during a game against Inter Milan; last year, the striker Michy Batshuayi, then playing for Borussia Dortmund, claimed that he was racially abused during a game at Atalanta, in Bergamo. Matuidi has previously been abused at Cagliari and at Verona.Football Against Racism in Europe, an activist group, has described the problem in Italy as an “epidemic,” linking it to a rise in far-right politics and anti-immigration policies.Advertisement
