Delaney did not answer questions from reporters as he left a meeting with the board on Monday.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday that he did not think anyone would be satisfied by Delaney's appearance at the committee, where, aside from reading an opening statement, he remained silent through most of the five-hour hearing.Delaney told the committee he offered the loan as the FAI potentially only had a few hours to resolve its cash-flow issues and that he recalled asking the association's then finance director if any disclosure obligations arose from it.Following the meeting, two of the FAI's main sponsors, sportswear manufacturer New Balance and mobile phone operator Three, called on the FAI to quickly implement recommendations from reports it has commissioned into its corporate governance.Groups representing supporters and players also demanded that Delaney, who is a member of European soccer body UEFA's executive committee, leave the association he took charge of in 2004.Lawmakers were told last week that only three members of the FAI's board were made aware of the loan in April 2017 and FAI chairman Donal Conway said the association would handle cash flow issues differently if they occurred again.The Sunday Times newspaper, which first reported details of the loan, reported on Sunday that Delaney spent almost 40,000 euros on his work credit card in the space of six months shortly before he had to personally bail out the association.Citing credit card statements, the newspaper said the charges included duty-free purchases, meals in Delaney's local pub and cash withdrawals of more than 6,000 euros.The FAI did not respond to questions from Reuters over whether the alleged use of the credit card contravened its rules and Delaney's solicitor did not respond when asked to comment on the report.
