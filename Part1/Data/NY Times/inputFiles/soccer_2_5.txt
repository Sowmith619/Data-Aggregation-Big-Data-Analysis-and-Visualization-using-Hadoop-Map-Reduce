David Duckenfield, the police officer in charge on the day. He had denied the charge. "We have discussed the matter carefully with counsel and I can confirm the CPS will seek a retrial against Mr Duckenfield," Sue Hemming from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.The jury did, however, find former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell guilty of a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act.The Hillsborough tragedy, which happened within minutes of kick-off, changed the face of English soccer. Banks of terracing and metal fences around pitches disappeared, replaced by modern, all-seated venues and better security.The jury had heard that 96 died as a result of a crush. However, under the law at the time, there could be no prosecution for the 96th victim as he died over a year after the tragedy."While forthcoming legal proceedings restrict comment on the outcome of the trial, we acknowledge the guilty verdict for Graham Mackrell and can empathise with the frustration shared by everyone affected by the Hillsborough tragedy that the outcome was not definitive," Liverpool FC said in a statement https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/announcements/342932-liverpool-fc-statement-hillsborough-trial."Furthermore, the journey not only to reach today’s stage and continue, is testament to the perseverance and determination of all involved in the ongoing campaign for justice which is now into its 30th year."
