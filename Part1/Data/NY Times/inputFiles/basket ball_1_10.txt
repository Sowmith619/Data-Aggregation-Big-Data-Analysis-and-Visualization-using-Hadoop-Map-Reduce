If the robot could learn a few more tricks, he was ready to accept the robot on the team, he said."We human players are still better for now," he said.Right after missing, the robot slumped over. It wasn't disappointment, but a temporary power failure.Cue 3's name is supposed to reflect the idea the technology can serve as a cue, or signal of great things to come, according to Toyota.The company plays down how the technology might prove useful. It's more about boosting morale among engineers, making them open to ideas and challenges.In making the robot's outer covering something like that of an armadillo, the engineers said they were just trying to avoid the white metallic look often seen on robots.The maker of the Camry sedan, Prius hybrid and Lexus luxury models has shown off various robots, including one that played a violin. Another, resembling R2-D2 of Star Wars, slides around and picks up things. At Monday's demonstration, it handed the basketball to Cue 3.Experts say robots that can mimic human movements, even doing them better, could prove useful in various ways, including picking crops, making deliveries, and working in factories and warehouses.Stanford University Professor Oussama Khatib, who directs the university's robotics lab, said Cue 3 demonstrates complex activities such as using sensors and nimble computation in real-time in what he called "visual feedback."To shoot hoops, the robot must have a good vision system, be able to compute the ball's path then execute the shot, he said in a telephone interview."What Toyota is doing here is really bringing the top capabilities in perception with the top capabilities in control to have robots perform something that is really challenging," Khatib said.Japan has been aggressive in developing humanoids, including those that do little more than offer cute companionship.Toyota's rival Honda Motor Co. has its Asimo, a culmination of research into creating a walking robot that started in the 1980s. It not only can run, but also recognize faces, avoid obstacles, shake hands, pour a drink and carry a tray.When will such robots be able to slam dunk, a feat that will require running, dribbling and jumping?"In 20 years, with technological advances," said Tomohiro Nomi, a Toyota engineer who worked on Cue 3.___On Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/yurikageyama/?hl=enAdvertisement
