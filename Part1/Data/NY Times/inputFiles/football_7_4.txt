Sport Ireland, however, said it was never notified about any deterioration in finances, as the FAI would have been obliged to do. "The Board of Sport Ireland will consider the reinstatement of funding once all ongoing reports commissioned by the FAI have been completed and the recommendations adopted," it said in a statement, referring to reviews the FAI has commissioned from audit firm Mazars and accountant Grant Thornton.The FAI, which generated a retained surplus of 2.8 million euros on revenues of 49 million in 2017, its last set of published reports, receives annual funding of 2.7 million euros from the state. It has already drawn down half of it for 2019.The FAI said it was unfortunate Sport Ireland felt compelled to suspend the funding, which was crucial to the development of Irish soccer."The Association is keen to restore trust and confidence and rebuild the relationship with Sport Ireland as soon as possible," FAI chairman Conway said in a statement.Lawmakers due to quiz the FAI on Wednesday welcomed the suspension and said they would also seek answers about the decision to move Delaney to another position in the association."It's a damning indictment that such shoddy financial and corporate governance practices were permitted. Hopefully this is the start of a real change," Noel Rock, a member of the governing Fine Gael party, said on Twitter. (Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Toby Davis)Advertisement
