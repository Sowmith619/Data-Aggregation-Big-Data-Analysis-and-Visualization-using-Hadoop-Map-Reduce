"The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer," Guardiola told a news conference on Friday."I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday."The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players.
