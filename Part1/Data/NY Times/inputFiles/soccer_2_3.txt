I know what I'm capable of," Lloyd, who was making her first start this year, told reporters after the match.Forward Lindsey Horan nodded in a goal off a corner kick past diving Belgian goalkeeper Nicky Evrard in the 26th minute and midfielder Samantha Mewis effectively put the game out of Belgium's reach with a header to put the hosts 4-0 ahead.Forward Alex Morgan came on as a substitute to start the second half and scored two minutes later when she broke free of her defender, took a pass from Lloyd, and chipped a shot over Evrard's head for her 101st career goal. Forward Jessica McDonald completed the rout with a header off a set-piece move in the 90th minute as the team improved to 4-1-2 in 2019.The match was the last for the U.S. before the team selects its World Cup roster, which will look to bring the team home its fourth title.
