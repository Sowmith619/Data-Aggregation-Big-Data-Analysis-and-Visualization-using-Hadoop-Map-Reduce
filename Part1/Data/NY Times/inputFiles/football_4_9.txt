Racism has no place in football, just as it has no place in society either,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino.Saturday's incident came two days after a group of Chelsea supporters were filmed singing an Islamophobic chant about Liverpool's Mohamed Salah before their Europa League match against Slavia Prague.Arsenal also launched an investigation after Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly was racially abused by a supporter during their Europa League match on Thursday.
