The investment into the technical division and St George's Park has played a major role in the progress of all of our teams."Last month, the England women's team won the SheBelieves Cup ahead of this year's World Cup for which they are viewed as one of the top contenders."Our commitment to women's football has also never been greater. Record investment into the infrastructure has made a real difference and, as a result, its popularity has grown significantly," Glenn added.Broadcasting and sponsorship income was again the largest revenue stream and the FA expects to see the financial benefit of a number of new deals coming into effect from the start of the 2018-19 season.These include a 12-year kit deal with Nike, a three-year FA Cup extension with title sponsor Emirates, a partnership with Budweiser and a record six-year deal for the international broadcast rights for the FA Cup with Pitch and IMG.
