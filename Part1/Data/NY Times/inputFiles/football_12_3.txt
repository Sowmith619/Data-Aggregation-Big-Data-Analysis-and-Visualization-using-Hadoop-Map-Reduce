Willian's fierce shot hit the bar in the first half before the hosts had a chance to open the scoring on the counter in the 69th minute when Ibrahim Traore drive into the Chelsea box and struck a shot that was superbly punched away by Kepa. The Spanish goalkeeper then kept out left-back Jan Boril's close-range shot in the 80th minute.Alonso's goal gave the Blues a vital away goal as they put behind them bitter memories of the stadium where they lost the 2013 Super Cup to Bayern Munich in a penalty shootout.Slavia defender Simon Deli said: “It’s disappointing because we did very well and in the last minutes we conceded this kind of goal. Of course, it’s difficult for us, but it’s football."Now we’ll prepare for our next game - the derby - and then against Chelsea in London,” he added referring to the Czech league leaders' game against third-placed Sparta on Sunday.
