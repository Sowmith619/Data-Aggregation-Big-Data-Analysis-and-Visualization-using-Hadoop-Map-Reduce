So will Ohio State pass rusher Nick Bosa, a potential No. 1 overall pick along with Murray.Haskins completed 70 percent of his passes for 4,831 yards with 50 touchdowns and eight interceptions in 14 starts last season.It's not uncommon for top players to skip the green room and attend draft parties at home with friends and family. The last two No. 1 overall selections -- Baker Mayfield in 2018 and Myles Garrett in 2017 -- opted not to attend the draft.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
