I don’t want any more charges. I've got three this week," said Warnock, who suggested that the other assistant, Ian Hussin, had been involved in overturning the decision, despite being situated at the other end of the field."It's annoying that someone from 75 yards away can tell someone else that it came off his head. The other linesman. A linesman who couldn’t see a toe poke go out. We keep getting kicked in the teeth."It’s a penalty. Were disappointed. Other than that it’s been a very good game."Cardiff are in 18th place with five games to go and need to catch up five points on 17th placed Brighton, who have a game in hand.The two teams face each other on Tuesday in a crunch game before Cardiff host Liverpool on Sunday.“I thought the lads were super, especially in the second half. Our fans were also fantastic," said Warnock.“Now we’ve got to overcome this disappointment and prepare for Brighton."The next five games we will be inundated with luck. I bet Liverpool are quaking in their boots now," he said with a grin. (Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar)Advertisement
