Experienced midfielder Katrina Gorry and Washington Spirit attacker Chloe Logarzo return after injuries, with 16-year-old striker Mary Fowler lured back after snubbing an international call-up by Stajcic last year.While more than half the squad play for U.S. teams, a large Australia-based contingent have had to get used to the freezing cold in Colorado quickly after traveling from balmy conditions back home."(It's) something we're not used to, we’re not used to the chill and it’s a different climate and a different atmosphere here but it’s been nice," said Melbourne-based forward Emily Gielnik.Following the friendly against Jill Ellis-coached United States, Australia switch to warmer climes in Turkey for a pre-World Cup camp before heading to France where they meet Italy, Brazil and Jamaica in Group C.
