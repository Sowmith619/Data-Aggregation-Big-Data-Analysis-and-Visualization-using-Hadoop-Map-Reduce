We are going to have to review everything we do."Very few times have I felt like this during my management career when I've looked at a team and not been able to see what we've worked on. We're going through one of those phases at the moment where we look a bit disjointed." (Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford)Advertisement
