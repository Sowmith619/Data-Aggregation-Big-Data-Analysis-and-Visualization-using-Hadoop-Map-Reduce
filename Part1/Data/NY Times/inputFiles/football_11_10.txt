Not because I'm better than any other but because I've been there."When someone has been there maybe it's good to listen to them, to rely on their experience. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't. I would like that when I say something, one would listen more."Alves, who spent six years at Sevilla and eight at Barcelona before moving to Italy in 2016, felt PSG should have been less complacent and more aware that history was against them."When you are up against a historical opponent in football, boxing, tennis, history will always be against you," he said.PSG are on the brink of an eighth Ligue 1 title, which they can clinch on Sunday by avoiding defeat at second-placed Lille.
