"Maybe I won so much with this club as a player that people expect different things from me. Now I see football from a different perspective."Krzysztof Piatek headed wide in an unmarked position at the far post from a Suso cross after 90 seconds in an early warning as Milan took control.Juve survived another fright when a Hakan Calhanoglu cross struck Alex Sandro's elbow at close range in the area, but after VAR review which lasted over three minutes, the referee decided it was unintentional.Minutes later, however, Leonardo Bonucci's pass out of defence was intercepted by Tiemoue Bakayoko and he fed the ball to Piatek who slotted past Wojciech Szczesny for his 21st league goal of the season -- eight for Milan and 13 for Genoa.Juventus were making little headway until they won a penalty following a clumsy challenge by Mateo Musacchio on Paulo Dybala, who converted the spot kick himself on the hour.The winner was similar to Milan's goal as Miralem Pjanic, another substitute, intercepted a pass out of defence and found Kean who calmly placed his shot beyond Pepe Reina with six minutes left.
