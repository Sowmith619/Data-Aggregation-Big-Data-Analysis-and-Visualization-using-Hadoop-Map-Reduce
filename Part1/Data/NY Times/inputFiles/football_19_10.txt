I couldn't see. I lost vision, definitely peripheral," Rodgers told ESPN about the injury he incurred after a sack against the Detroit Lions.Rodgers also went into detail about the knee injury he suffered in Week 1 and then reinjured in Week 5. Rodgers left the game against the Chicago Bears but returned to engineer the 20-point comeback victory.Rodgers called it an "indent fracture.""I had a tibial plateau fracture and obviously an MCL sprain," Rodgers told ESPN. "So that was very painful. If you watch the hit back, just my two bones here that come together on the outside just kind of made an indent fracture. Very painful."Rodgers did not require surgery and said he returned from a vacation in New Zealand feeling "incredible."Rodgers said he's "excited about working" with new coach Matt LaFleur."I think any great quarterback-to-play-caller relationship is a good partnership. We both know who the boss is and it's him. But it works better when it's a partnership," Rodgers told ESPN.--Field Level MediaAdvertisement
