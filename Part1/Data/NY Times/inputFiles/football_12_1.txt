"Indeed, from the outset he said that he did not even know what one was."Improbable as that may seem to those of us of an older generation, we do not reject that assertion as untrue."In fact, when cross-examined about this Mr Hennessey displayed a very considerable - one might even say lamentable - degree of ignorance about anything to do with Hitler, Fascism and the Nazi regime."The report said that while such ignorance was regrettable, it did not mean the player was not telling the truth."All we would say (at the risk of sounding patronising) is that Mr Hennessey would be well advised to familiarise himself with events which continue to have great significance to those who live in a free country," it added.
