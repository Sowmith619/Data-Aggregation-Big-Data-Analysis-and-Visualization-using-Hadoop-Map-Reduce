It should send a strong deterrent message to all players that the RFU takes the misuse of substances seriously."Sale described Pope's behaviour as "unacceptable" but offered their support."The club does not condone the misuse of drugs from any player and accept the decision made by the RFU," the Premiership club said in a statement on their website.
