The 77-year-old billionaire businessman has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor charges of soliciting sex and requested a jury trial in March.William Burck, Kraft's attorney, argued in Palm Beach County Court that surveillance footage from the spa should not be released to the media because it would violate Kraft's privacy rights, compromise his right to a fair trial, and interfere in an active criminal investigation. "It's basically pornography," Burck told Judge Leonard Hanser. "There's no interest in actually seeing the video unless you have a prurient interest in seeing the video."Kraft's attorneys filed a motion to suppress the video in March, further suggesting that police did not have a valid search warrant to collect the video as evidence. Dana McElroy, an attorney representing the media outlets, argued that sealing the video would violate the state's public records law.Kraft apologized for his actions in a written statement issued last month.
