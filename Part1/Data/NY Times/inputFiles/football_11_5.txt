A hearing on that matter is scheduled for next week.In a letter filed with the court on Thursday, Kraft's lawyers accused prosecutors of committing "gross prosecutorial misconduct" by suggesting they would release the footage before its legality has been established.Authorities in February announced misdemeanor charges against the 77-year-old Kraft and 24 other men for soliciting prostitution, part of a broader investigation of sex trafficking at massage parlors.Media companies including ABC and ESPN opposed Kraft's motion, saying the judge would violate Florida's public records laws by suppressing the video.Kraft purchased the Patriots, one of the National Football League's most successful franchises, in 1994. The team won its sixth Super Bowl under his ownership in February. (Reporting by Dan Whitcomb; Additional reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Leslie Adler)Advertisement
