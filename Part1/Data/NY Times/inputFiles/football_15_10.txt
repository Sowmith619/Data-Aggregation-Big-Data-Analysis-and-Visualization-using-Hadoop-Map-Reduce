He has also been awarded the John Eales Medal for best Australian rugby player three times, more than anyone else.His departure would leave the Wallabies without one of their top players less than six months before the Rugby World Cup, which starts in September in Japan.Mr. Folau, a former Mormon who is now a member of the Pentecostal denomination Assemblies of God, has a history of making homophobic and transphobic comments.On Tuesday, he commented on Twitter about the Tasmanian Parliament passing legislation to make gender optional on birth certificates, saying, “The devil has blinded so many people in this world, REPENT and turn away from your evil ways. Turn to Jesus Christ who will set you free.”In September 2017, he expressed his opposition to same-sex marriage on Twitter even as his team, the Wallabies, was encouraging Australians to vote in favor of it in a nationwide postal survey.Last April, Mr. Folau posted a comment on Instagram that God’s plan for gay people was “HELL” unless they “repent of their sins.” Rugby Australia issued him with a warning in response.In a column later that month for Players Voice, an Australian sports site featuring writing by athletes, he wrote, “I do not have any phobia towards anyone.”He also wrote: “This is not about money or bargaining power or contracts. It’s about what I believe in and never compromising that, because my faith is far more important to me than my career and always will be.”Want more Australia coverage and discussion?
