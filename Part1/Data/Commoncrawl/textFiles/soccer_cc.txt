Utah State and Air Force face the toughest nonconference schedules in the Mountain West Conference heading into the 2019-20 football season.Here are the rankings from toughest to easiest:1. Utah StateAug. 30 at Wake Forest; Sept. 7 Stony Brook; Oct. 5 at LSU; Nov. 2 BYUOverview: For the third straight year, Utah State opens up the season on the road at a Power 5 opponent. The Aggies travel to North Carolina to take on Wake Forest in search of the program’s second win in the series (1-1). In October, the team travels to LSU in hopes of snapping a 10-game losing streak to teams from the SEC.2. Air ForceAug. 31 Colgate; Sept. 14 at Colorado; Oct. 5 at Navy; Nov. 2 ArmyOverview: The last time Air Force and Colorado faced each other, the Buffaloes were still a member of the Big Eight Conference (1974). The Falcons are looking to snap a five-game losing streak in the series. The out-of-conference schedule wraps up with the annual showdowns with Navy and Army. Air Force has won the Commander-in-Chief’s trophy (given to the top service academy) four times since 2010 (2010, 2011, 2014 and 2016).3. New MexicoAug. 31 Sam Houston State; Sept. 14 at Notre Dame; Sept. 21 New Mexico State; Sept. 28 at LibertyOverview: New Mexico’s trip to South Bend to take on Notre Dame is a homecoming of sorts for Lobos coach Bob Davie, who led the Fighting Irish to a 35-25 record in the five seasons from 1997-2001. It’s the first meeting between the two schools with New Mexico looking to snap a three-game losing streak on the road dating back to last season.4. HawaiiAug. 24 Arizona; Sept. 7 Oregon State; Sept. 14 at Washington; Sept. 21 Central Arkansas; Nov. 30 ArmyOverview: Hawaii has lost nine out of its last 10 games against teams from the Pac-12 which is bad news for a Rainbow Warriors team which opens the season with three consecutive games against the league. The good news is five of the program’s 30 wins against Pac-12 programs have come against Oregon State (3-7) and Washington (2-3).5. Boise StateAug. 31 vs. Florida State (Jacksonville); Sept. 6 Marshall; Sept. 14 Portland State; Oct. 19 at BYUOverview: Boise State travels to Florida for the program’s first regular-season neutral-site matchup since 2014 with a matchup against Florida State at TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville. This is the first meeting between the two programs with the Seminoles traveling to Idaho next season. Boise State is 2-0 on the road against teams from the ACC.6. NevadaAug. 30 Purdue; Sept. 7 at Oregon; Sept. 14 Weber State; Sept. 21 at UTEPOverview: It’s been more than a dozen years since Nevada last hosted a team from the Big Ten as the Wolf Pack open the season against Purdue. The program is 1-6 all-time against Big Ten teams with the lone win coming in that home game against Northwestern in 2006. A week later, Jay Norvell’s team travels to Oregon, looking for the program’s first win over the Ducks since 1947.7. UNLVAug. 31 Southern Utah; Sept. 7 Arkansas State; Sept. 14 at Northwestern; Oct. 12 at VanderbiltOverview: The Rebels are 0-5 against teams from Power 5 conference in the four seasons under Tony Sanchez with the program’s last win against a P5 opponent coming more than a decade ago. UNLV looks to snap the streak with road contests against Northwestern and Vanderbilt. The school is a combined 3-19 against teams from those conferences.8. San Diego StateAug. 31 Weber State; Sept. 7 at UCLA; Sept. 14 at New Mexico State; Nov. 30 BYUOverview: San Diego State has been a strong road team under coach Rocky Long but the Aztecs struggled last season, finishing with a 2-3 mark. The team travels to UCLA to take on the Bruins in the Rose Bowl, where the team is winless (0-21). The out-of-conference schedule wraps up in November with the Aztecs looking to snap a 6-game losing streak to BYU.9. Colorado StateAug. 30 vs. Colorado (Denver); Sept. 7 Western Illinois; Sept. 14 at Arkansas; Sept. 21 ToledoOverview: Colorado State coach Mike Bobo spent more than a decade as an assistant coach at Georgia so the 45-year-old is all-too-familiar with the SEC as the Rams travel to Arkansas to take on the Razorbacks. Last season’s 34-27 win over Arkansas was the first over the Hogs in the series and the second against an SEC opponent since beating LSU in 1992.10. San Jose StateAug. 29 Northern Colorado; Sept. 7 Tulsa; Sept. 21 at Arkansas; Oct. 26 at ArmyOverview: San Jose State is 2-11 in the past three seasons with both wins coming against teams from the Football Championship Subdivision. The program’s last win over a Power 5 was more than a decade ago (2006) with the Spartans winless (0-6) against teams from the SEC. To point, San Jose State’s last nonconference road win came against Navy in 2012.11. WyomingAug. 31 Missouri; Sept. 7 at Texas State; Sept. 14 Idaho; Sept. 21 at TulsaOverview: Wyoming is 9-13 against nonconference foes since Craig Bohl took over the program in 2014 including a 1-9 record on the road. Luckily for the Cowboys, their toughest out-of-conference test comes at War Memorial Stadium against Missouri. The program has three wins against SEC teams with all three victories coming since 2004.12. Fresno StateAug. 31 at USC; Sept. 7 Minnesota; Sept. 21 Sacramento State; Sept. 28 at New Mexico StateOverview: Fresno State finished last season with a four-game winning streak including wins in the conference championship game and the Las Vegas Bowl. The Bulldogs hope to carry momentum into the opener against USC, a program they’ve lost three straight games in the series. A week later, the team returns home to face Minnesota. Fresno State lost to the Gophers 21-14 last September.Southern Miss and Rice face the toughest nonconference schedules in Conference USA heading into the 2019-20 football season.Here are the rankings from toughest to easiest:1.

They’re like friends you might chat with. The wrentit and the Abert’s towhee are like the neighbors you don’t talk to much. As for the Hammond’s flycatcher and the Brewer’s sparrow, Americans don’t care much about them at all.That’s the word from a new study that aimed to define “a range of relationships between people and birds” across the United States, said Justin Schuetz, one of the authors.Results appear in a paper released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Schuetz, a biologist and independent researcher in Bath, Maine, did the work with Alison Johnston, who’s affiliated with Cornell University in Ithaca, New YorkThe project included studying Google searches performed from 2008 to 2017 to learn about what Americans think about 621 bird species. Researchers knew where each search came from. They also knew the natural range of each species and how often it is sighted in specific places, based on a national database.One key question was whether the Google data revealed more interest in each species than one would expect in various locations, based on how often it is sighted in those places. Another question was how much the interest in each species was limited to its natural range, or spilled out beyond it.So birds in the “celebrity” category are those that attracted more Google attention than one would expect from how often they’re seen, and whose popularity extended outside of their natural range. They have “a reputation beyond where they live,” Schuetz explained.Next came the “friends or enemies” category, which included species that get more Google attention than expected, but mostly in the states where they live. As with the other categories, the researchers couldn’t tell whether the searchers’ opinions of these familiar birds were positive or negative.Then came birds classified as “neighbors,” whose few Google searches were confined to where they live. Finally there were the “strangers,” birds that got little Google interest anywhere.The research also turned up other insights into what makes a species popular. Bigger bodies, colorful plumage and regular visits to birdfeeders helped. Species that served as mascots for professional sports teams reached celebrity status, but it wasn’t clear whether being a mascot encouraged popularity or the other way around.The results also turned up some surprises. “People seem to have an inordinate fascination with owls we couldn’t account for entirely in our analysis,” Schuetz said.Jeffrey Gordon, president of the American Birding Association, called the study “a fascinating framework for trying to understand how people are relating to birds.”“I hope they’re able to use it to help people appreciate what’s right in their own backyard,” he said. “Most of us just aren’t keyed in to what is literally at our doorstep.”David Ringer, chief network officer for the National Audubon Society, also found the work interesting.“It’s great to see how much we know and love some species, and it’s provocative to see how much we still have to discover,” he wrote in an email. “I hope that many bird ‘strangers’ will become ‘friends,’ and ‘neighbors’ will turn into ‘celebrities.'”___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

But the claims are largely unproven, quality control standards don’t exist and the legal status of CBD-infused food is in doubt.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to hold a public hearing May 31 to gather more information on the science, manufacturing and sale of cannabis compounds such as CBD.A look at what we know as U.S. regulators work out what will and won’t be allowed:WHAT IS CBD?CBD is one of more than 100 compounds found in marijuana. It’s extracted using alcohol or carbon dioxide in factories. It’s added to oils, mixed into creams and lotions and sold in candies and liquid drops.Widely sold online, CBD now is going mainstream. Prices range from $12 to $150 an ounce at high-end shops.CBD often comes from a cannabis plant known as hemp, which is defined by the U.S. government as having less than 0.3% THC. That’s important because THC is what causes marijuana’s mind-altering effect.CBD doesn’t get people high, although it may be calming. Keep in mind some CBD products may contain THC, whether or not the label says so.People drug tested for work, addiction programs or because they take prescription opioids should take note: CBD products have caused people to fail urine drug screens.IS IT A MIRACLE CURE?If you believe the hype, CBD treats pain, relieves anxiety and both helps you sleep and keeps you focused.Most claims are based on studies in rats, mice or in test tubes. Some human research has been done, but in small numbers of people.One exception: For two rare seizure disorders, the evidence for CBD was strong enough to convince the FDA to approve GW Pharmaceutical’s drug Epidiolex, which contains a purified form.The FDA has sent warning letters to companies marketing products with claims for CBD’s effects on cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, fibromyalgia and drug addiction.Only drugs that have been reviewed by the FDA as safe and effective can make claims that they treat or prevent diseases or medical conditions. Many CBD producers attempt to sidestep the issue by using only vague language about general health and well-being.ANY SIDE EFFECTS?Scant research means not much is known about side effects either. In epilepsy research, CBD changed the way the body processed other drugs. That suggests CBD could interact with medications in ways we still don’t know about.The most common side effects of the CBD drug Epidiolex include sleepiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea, increases in liver enzymes, exhaustion, rash and infections. The potential for liver injury and other risks can be handled with medical supervision, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said earlier this month, but less is known about how that would be managed without oversight. And there are questions about overlap if multiple CBD products are used.IS IT LEGAL?For now, the FDA has said CBD is not allowed as an ingredient in food, drinks or dietary supplements.In stating its position, the FDA cited a provision of the law prohibiting food makers from using active drug ingredients or those still undergoing substantial research. But the agency doesn’t have the resources to police all the CBD products that are already available, said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA official.“They’re not going to pull a thousand products from the market,” he said.The FDA’s authority is over interstate commerce, and local officials have taken differing approaches. In New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, officials are warning eateries to stop selling it in food and drinks. Maine passed a law allowing it in foods and other products in the state.Skin creams and cosmetics may be on safer footing with the FDA, but that too remains uncertain, said Camille Gourdet of RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in Durham, North Carolina. Though cosmetics aren’t subject to premarket approval by the FDA, they could run afoul of regulations if they make specific health claims.Marijuana itself is illegal under federal law; most states that have legalized it allow marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles.ARE CBD LABELS ACCURATE?What you buy may contain much less CBD than the label states — or much more. It may include more THC than you want and it may be contaminated with mold or pesticides. Ask to see testing reports.A 2017 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found 70% of CBD products were mislabeled. Researchers used an independent lab to test 84 products from 31 companies.“You’re really flying by the seat of your pants when you buy this stuff,” said author Marcel Bonn-Miller of University of Pennsylvania.A product labeled as containing 100 milligrams of CBD may only have 5 milligrams or it may have 200, said Bonn-Miller, now an adviser for a company that sells CBD and other cannabis products. He did not work in the industry when he did the research.“I wouldn’t trust any of it until I knew independently it was safe,” Bonn-Miller said.WHAT’S AHEAD?CBD research is planned or underway for cancer, autism, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, alcoholism with PTSD and psychiatric conditions. Results will take years, but some people aren’t waiting.“They are vulnerable and really hoping to feel better,” said Karen Hande, a nurse practitioner at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville.She became an expert in CBD because so many of her cancer patients were trying it. She tells them the evidence isn’t enough to back the claims, but “they want to believe something is going to work.”___Follow AP’s complete marijuana coverage: https://apnews.com/Marijuana___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

		Powered by WordPress.com VIP BILLINGS, Mont. — State officials will challenge a court ruling that revoked the water permit for a silver and copper mine proposed beneath a Montana wilderness area, a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation spokesman said Monday.Judge Kathy Seeley ruled state officials didn’t adequately consider potential damage to nearby streams from Hecla Mining Co.’s Rock Creek Mine northeast of Noxon.Attorneys for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation plan to file an appeal, said agency spokesman John Grassy. He declined to offer further details.The April 9 ruling does not affect the ability of Idaho-based Hecla to conduct exploratory work for the mine, which the U.S. Forest Service gave preliminary approval to last year, company spokesman Luke Russell said Monday.Environmental groups represented by Earthjustice had argued that streams within the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness are so ecologically valuable that they deserve the greatest protections available under law.Seeley agreed and in her April 9 order sent the matter back to the Department of Natural Resources Conservation for reconsideration.“It’s great news for wilderness, rivers and streams the critical habitat they provide for fish and wildlife,” said Bonnie Gestring with Earthworks, one of the groups that challenged the water permit after it was issued in January 2018.Rock Creek would employ about 300 people and cover almost 500 acres.Montana regulators in a separate case have asked a judge to block Hecla CEO Phillips Baker, Jr. from exploring or opening new mines. They allege he’s in violation of the state’s “bad actor” law because of ongoing pollution from a mining company where Baker once worked.New York Red Bulls midfielder Kaku was sent off with a red card in the final moments of the Red Bulls’ 2-2 draw with Sporting Kansas City last night, after he kicked a ball in frustration and it struck a fan in the front row. The fan reportedly was left with a bloody face and needing medical attention. According to Red Bulls midfielder Daniel Royer, Kaku didn’t mean to hit anyone. “[Kaku] definitely meant to hit the board” in front of the first row of seats, Royer said, per ESPN. Kaku, who appeared angry about a botched pass just before he launched the ball into the stands, misfired, hitting the fan and sparking a shoving match on the sideline. At around the 17-second mark in the video above, behind the players’ scrum, you can see a fan slumped over and the people next to him gesturing to the usher for help.After the game, Kaku tweeted out several apologies. AdvertisementWith the red card, Kaku will automatically miss the team’s next game, but he’ll likely face a longer suspension for endangering a fan. This morning, the Red Bulls put out a statement about the incident:“The New York Red Bulls organization does not condone the type of behavior displayed near the end of Sunday night’s match in Kansas City. We hold everyone in our organization to a high standard of conduct. The matter will continue to be discussed internally and we will have no further comment at this time.”AdvertisementThe fan, at least, appeared to be ok after the game.Reporter at Deadspin.With a tight 1-0 home win over Sheffield Wednesday this weekend, Leeds United took a big step toward sealing promotion to the Premier League next season. In the explosion of joy following Jack Harrison’s 65th minute goal, one Leeds fan exploded his ankle during his raucous celebration, which required a surgery that the madman put off by waiting until after the match was over before going to the hospital.Here’s a photo of the fan, identified as 18-year-old Matt Richardson, after he screwed up his ankle but before he left the stadium, tweeted out by @ArchaeoWill. WARNING: This is pretty gross:Richardson himself tweeted another photo of his foot once he was at the hospital:The Yorkshire Evening Post caught up with Richardson and let him explain himself. Here, he lays out what happened:“I jumped up, ran down the steps, I missed my step and fell over,” Richardson said.“Next thing I know, I look at my ankle and it’s like falling off.”“I looked down and I thought: ‘I probably need to go hospital’ but my main priority was to carry on watching the game.”AdvertisementRichardson said he did flag the on-site paramedics over, who naturally advised him to leave immediately to get his foot checked out, but he refused. “I was more interested in the fact Leeds are going to the Premier League!” Richardson told the Post. After the final whistle, the stadium’s support staff lugged him away:The overly fanatical teen also talked about how he was able to snap a bone in his leg and still sit there cheerily for about a half-hour before going to the hospital:“I managed to crack a smile because for so many years I’ve gone to Elland Road and watched absolute rubbish.“Finally we have team with passion and desire to win, and that makes me proud to be a Leeds fan, so the passion overcame the pain.”AdvertisementWith only four matches left in the Championship season, Leeds are currently in the second of the table’s two automatic promotion places, clear of third place by three points. Maybe it really is worth potentially losing your foot (though it seems like Richardson will be fine) to watch your beloved club put one foot of its own into the Premier League.[Yorkshire Evening Post]WriterAfter working hard and officially earning All-State status just a couple of weeks ago from the Oklahoma Girls Basketball Coaches Association, Ardmore’s Sierra Gordon and Sulphur’s Payton Row decided to double down on their senior honors earlier this week.After working hard and officially earning All-State status just a couple of weeks ago from the Oklahoma Girls Basketball Coaches Association, Ardmore’s Sierra Gordon and Sulphur’s Payton Row decided to double down on their senior honors earlier this week.Both senior standouts were given another All-State award, as they were both named to the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-State list for girls basketball. Gordon was named to the Large West squad, while Row was named to the Small West squad. The 2019 OCA All-State games will take place on July 24 at the Mabee Center on the campus of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa. It was a banner season for Gordon as she helped lead the Lady Tigers back to the Class 5A state tournament for the second time in three seasons.Gordon finished her season averaging 17.3 points per game to go with 3.3 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.4 rebounds per game. She was also a member of the 2017-18 All-Ardmoreite girls basketball team, and a Class 5A selection for the Large West on the All-Star by Class team as well.As for Row, she completed a stellar senior season for the Lady Bulldogs, helping them reach the state tournament for the first time since 2013 this season.She was named to the All-Tournament team for the Class 3A state tournament, as well as the MVP for the Madill Winter Classic.

			Even by the standards of a line of work that can be dangerous, it was an unusually violent attack.			
						London Police headquarters (File photo)						


Even by the standards of a line of work that can be dangerous, it was an unusually violent attack.A London woman was attacked with a stun gun and robbed early Monday, with her vehicle taken, by a man she’d met through an online advertisement, leaving police looking for a suspect and warning those involved in the sex trade to be wary.One women’s advocate said she’s worried the violence could be the fallout of a recent decision by London police to publish the names of johns, or men accused of buying sex.Jessie Rodger said she “had major concerns” about the recent police decision to start naming johns, because there’s peer-reviewed evidence that approach will increase violence and decrease the safety of sex workers.“I don’t know if there is any way for us to know, but this will always come up for me and for our organization to wonder when violence happens toward sex workers, if this is part of it,” said Rodger, executive director of Anova, an organization that provides support and shelter to victims of sexual violence and abuse.London police were looking for a suspect in the assault, which happened shortly after midnight Monday at a home in the area of Wellington and Simcoe streets, just south of the downtown.The new police practice to publicly name men accused of buying sex makes the men reluctant to give their names when trying to meet sex workers, Rodger said. Men who trade in fake names stop sex trade workers from being able to speak to one another about potential clients to assess their own safety.“If they give a fake name, (the workers) don’t know,” Rodger said. “Their ability to vet is down.”Police, who weren’t immediately available for followup questions about the implications of the attack, say a man went to the home after communicating with a woman through an online ad.Hand-held stun guns, which deliver a jolt of electricity, are prohibited weapons in Canada, their use legally restricted to law enforcement agencies.The woman in Monday’s attack had minor injuries and didn’t seek any medical attention, police said.Police Chief John Pare recently changed the city police policy about naming johns, a move to help fight human trafficking in the sex trade.London police previously had withheld the names of accused johns, even in human trafficking investigations, saying most would avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex-trade industry.Decades of research shows that naming johns puts sex trade workers at risk, a London sex-work researcher has said.“I don’t know how the decision was made. It is a perfect illustration of ignoring research in favour of moralizing,” said Treena Orchard, a health studies researcher at Western University, told The Free Press earlier this year.Worried about being named, johns will take sex workers to more isolated or hidden places. Sex workers facing a declining number of clients will be forced to lower their prices, work longer hours or take greater risks with unknown johns.Rodger said she’s received several alerts about men who are threats to sex-trade workers over the last few months.“This one is a little more concerning and violent, but I wouldn’t say its super-uncommon,” she said. “(I have) absolute concern for women who participate in sex work, absolute concern on how we support and we make sure they are safe.”In a statement Monday, SafeSpace London, a collective of sex workers and advocates for the decriminalization of prostitution, said getting warned about a violent predator “is great,” but much more is needed to make their working conditions safer.“We need decriminalization,” the group said in its statement. “It is a first and essential step, while we address the other systemic issues that reduce the likelihood someone is in sex work from a place of consent.”Police described the suspect in Monday’s attack as black, between 25 and 40 years of age, about five-foot-eight and 200 pounds, with short hair. Police say he was clean-shaven and wore a black and grey toque and a black hooded sweatshirt.The vehicle reported stolen in Monday’s attack is a 2019 red Toyota RAV4, with licence plate CHDY928.Anyone with information is asked to contact London police at 519 661-5670.— With files by Randy Richmondhrivers@postmedia.comTwitter.com/HeatheratLFP365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

Joey Hauser will have three years of eligibility after sitting out next season."We are thankful for all that Sam and Joey contributed to our program and University during their time at Marquette and wish them the best of luck in the future," head coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of returning players and are extremely excited about the upcoming season and future of our program."Sam, a 6-foot-8 junior, averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He shot 40.2 percent from 3-point range, marking the third season in a row he's made at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers.Joey, a 6-foot-9 freshman, averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his first season at Marquette. He also shot 42.5 percent from 3.Both players are officially in the transfer portal, sources told ESPN.With leading scorer Markus Howard back, Wojciechowski expected to have one of the best teams in the country next season. Without the Hausers, the Golden Eagles will likely fall toward the back end of the preseason top 25.Meanwhile, the Hausers will be two of the most sought-after transfers on the market.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?

It’s a sport you may not even know exists, but it’s one in which a 16-year-old athlete from Southwestern Ontario is drawing raves internationally.Exeter’s Logan Finch will represent Canada at the World Scooter Championship in Barcelona, Spain, in July. Yes, scooter championships.Similar to skateboarding, the sport consists of riding through a course of ramps and other obstacles while performing tricks on a scooter. Competitors are scored on factors such as the complexity of their tricks, their style and speed, and their use of the course.Although skateboarding remains the more popular of the two sports, scootering — as it is more commonly known — has been gaining popularity over the last few years, especially in the United States, Australia and parts of Europe.This is the first time Finch, who has been practising the sport for about five years, has made it to the international level after falling short the last couple of years in the qualifying rounds in California — something he says made qualifying this year that much sweeter.“I’m pretty happy,” he said. “I’ve been wanting to (qualify) to this event almost for as long as I have been scootering, and it feels pretty good to know that I will be competing with the best in the world.”Finch secured his spot last month after finishing second at a qualifying round held in nearby Zurich that attracted 25 athletes from North America.Finch said he started scootering simply because he thought it was fun.He said he would go on YouTube and watch videos of other people to learn new tricks and then practised them on his own.

In short order, he was sharing videos of his own tricks on social media, which allowed him to get his first sponsor when he was 12 years old. From there, Finch went on to participate in competitions across the province and, eventually, North America.Since there’s no age limit, Finch, at 16, will likely be one of the younger, if not the youngest, participants at the Barcelona competition.His parents, Lori and Bill, and his older brother Mitchell, who they say are Finch’s No. 1 supporters, will travel with him.“For us, it’s been awesome to watch Logan grow from an intermediate rider to pro to now qualifying at worlds,” Lori Finch said. “It’s totally amazing.”As for his own expectations, Logan Finch says he will be taking this event as a learning opportunity.“I just kind of want to have fun there,” he said.jjuha@postmedia.comTwitter.com/JuhaatLFPress365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

Les pays qui, comme Madagascar ou le Burundi, viennent pour la première fois, jouent en général avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. Ils viennent aussi avec beaucoup de supporters. J'ai beaucoup de respect pour Madagascar. C'est un pays que j'adore. Il y a beaucoup de bons footballeurs là-bas. Il y a aussi le Burundi qui a sorti le Gabon en éliminatoires. Il ne faudra pas sous-estimer les Burundais. En tout cas, on les prendra très au sérieux » a expliqué Gernot Rohr, entraîneur du Nigeria après le tirage au sort. Mais à deux mois de cette joute continentale, deux joueurs malgaches sont blessés à savoir Lalaina Nomenjanahary touché à la cheville et Zotsara Randriambololona au genou droit. Comme les Barea sont maintenant fixés sur leurs adversaires, les férus du ballon rond et les joueurs attendent une préparation digne d'une équipe qualifiée à la CAN. En sport, il n'y a pas de magie, on ne récolte que ce qu'on mérite ... .Calendrier22 juin : Madagascar contre Guinée.27 juin : Madagascar contre Burundi.30 Juin : Madagascar Contre Nigeria.Lire l'article original sur Midi Madagasikara.Copyright © 2019 Midi Madagasikara.

That motivated them to get on the same page and make huge gains following their 10-0 setback to Gilbert in the opener.“They only had one goal and didn’t score in the last five minutes, so that helps,” Collins-Maxwell forward Caitlyn Bruntz said. “Our first win against Ballard feels really good.”Ballard had the momentum early, but Collins-Maxwell started to take control 10 minutes into the game.The Spartans caught a huge break 19 minutes, 55 seconds into the game when they were awarded a penalty kick. Bruntz converted to get her team on the board.Less than two minutes later Collins-Maxwell struck again, this time with Tori Bienfang finding the net to put all the momentum on the Spartans side.“This game was about slowing it down and getting our crosses in because against Gilbert we had zero,” Bruntz said. “We really tried to feed the ball better to our forwards, and get those crosses and through balls in.”Bienfang established herself as a big weapon against the Bombers in just her second varsity start to complement Bruntz, the team’s leading returning scorer from a year ago.“She’s like a bulldozer,” Bruntz said. “She just plows people over — very aggressive. We need that against teams that are aggressive like Ballard.”Collins-Maxwell maintained that 2-0 lead at the half. Ballard started putting up a better fight in the second half, but at the 61:29 mark of the game, Bruntz nailed a beautiful cross shot from midrange that made it past Bomber keeper Sierra Knight for a 3-0 Spartan advantage.Ballard picked up the pace in the final 15 minutes.Brooke Loewe got the Bombers on the board with 10:09 remaining. The Bombers kept up the pressure the rest of the way, but with keeper Elise Robertson directing traffic for the defense, the Spartans held Ballard scoreless the rest of the way.“I think communication went way better this time,” Robertson said. “I think we played more together tonight.”Robertson finished with 12 saves. Both teams had 13 shots on goal.Collins-Maxwell improved to 1-1 and Ballard suffered its first defeat, dropping to 2-1. After struggling for most of the first 60 minutes, Bomber head girls’ soccer coach Brent Emerson was happy with how his team fought back to make things interesting down the stretch.“I’ve got to give them a lot of credit, but the good thing for our kids is we really battled the second half,” Emerson said. “We got a lot of shots on goal; we just didn’t get them in the right places. ”This was a good test for us and a good kind of wakeup call to go forward. We’ve got a lot of big games on the horizon.”Knight made 10 saves at keeper for Ballard. The Bombers must regroup quickly as they travel to Boone tomorrow.Collins-Maxwell’s next outing is at Grand View Christian next Tuesday.Collins-Maxwell 3, Ballard 1B 0 1 - 1CM 2 1 - 3ScoringFirst halfCM - Caitlyn Bruntz, 19:55.CM - Tori Bienfang, 21:01.Second halfCM - Bruntz, 61:29.B - Brooke Loewe, 69:51.© Copyright 2006-2019 GateHouse Media, LLC.

There’s not much to be sure of when it comes to the No. 58 pick of the 2019 NFL draft. Right now, it’s owned by the Dallas Cowboys and unless they make a trade to change things, it will be their first selection of draft weekend. There’s not much certainty beyond that, and certainly no assurances of which prospects will be available for them to choose from.That changes the complexion of this year’s draft process. Dallas hasn’t been without a first rounder for a decade, after giving up their 2009 first-round pick to Detroit in the trade for WR Roy Williams. That year, they bailed on the second round of a weak draft class and ended up getting a haul to be forgotten. Hopefully that isn’t the sentence handed down to Dallas this year. Will there be the necessary talent left at No. 58 to avoid such miserableness?Dane Brugler of The Athletic (subscription required) has released his annual draft guide, essential and required reading for all and as per usual, at the end is his Top 100 list.While players ranked below No. 58 are able to be taken before Dallas gets on the clock, it feels like a safe bet they’ll be able to pick and choose from those prospects in the 10 slots before 58 and the 10 after; call it 10 Up, 10 Down.Here’s a quick look at those names.49. JUAN THORNHILL S Virginia
50. JULIAN LOVE CB Notre Dame
51. KELVIN HARMON WR NC State
52. N’KEAL HARRY WR Arizona State
53. DANIEL JONES QB Duke
54. MACK WILSON LB Alabama
55. DAMIEN HARRIS RB Alabama
56. DRE’MONT JONES DL Ohio State
57. DEIONTE THOMPSON S Alabama
58. DARNELL SAVAGE JR. S Maryland
59. RILEY RIDLEY WR Georgia
60. CHASE WINOVICH EDGE Michigan
61. L.J. COLLIER EDGE TCU
62. HAKEEM BUTLER WR Iowa State
63. KALEB McGARY OT Washington
64. ANDY ISABELLA WR Massachusetts
65. JAHLANI TAVAI LB Hawaii
66. JOEJUAN WILLIAMS CB Vanderbilt
67. JJ ARCEGA-WHITESIDE WR Stanford
68. AMANI HOOKER S IowaThe names bolded were invited to Dallas as either 30 visits or part of Dallas Day. There are 4 safeties in this range, which is a position the Cowboys are clearly interested in this draft process. There are also two cornerbacks listed, in case Dallas wants to plan ahead for the losses they could take on at the position as early as next season.On the surface the Cowboys don’t need a wideout either, but four of their top five receivers are in the final year of their deals, including No. 1 Amari Cooper whom the club still hasn’t extended. Over 25 percent of this list are wideouts.

                                            Smoke could be seen billowing out from the top of the medieval cathedral, as flames leapt out besides its two bell towers, a Reuters witness said.
                                        PARIS - Notre-Dame Cathedral went up in flames on Monday in a roaring blaze that devastated the Parisian landmark, one of France’s most visited places.Flames burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and quickly engulfed the spire, which collapsed.A huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area.“Everything is collapsing,” a police officer near the scene said as the entire roof of the cathedral continued to burn.Firefighters cleared the area around the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Buildings around were evacuated.President Emmanuel Macron cancelled an address to the nation that he had been due to give later on Monday evening. A presidential official said Macron was to go to the scene of the blaze.“A terrible fire is under way at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris,” Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter.France 2 television reported that police were treating the incident as an accident.The cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, features in Victor Hugo’s classic novel “The Hunchback of Notre-Dame”. It attracts millions of tourists every year.Notre-Dame was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding and bronze statues were removed last week for works.

                                            After citizens from Syria, those from Venezuela were the second-largest group among the 57,000 people who asked for asylum in February in the EU, Switzerland and Norway, according to official figures.

                                        BRUSSELS - Venezuelans and other Latin Americans are filing a surge in requests for asylum in European countries, which are more accustomed to dealing with migrants from the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, figures showed Monday.After citizens from Syria, those from Venezuela were the second-largest group among the 57,000 people who asked for asylum in February in the EU, Switzerland and Norway, according to official figures.Venezuelans fleeing their crisis-hit country filed more asylum applications than Afghans, Iraqis and Nigerians, the next-biggest groups, the European Asylum Support Office said in a statement."The fact that Venezuelans lodged more applications than Afghans represents a noticeable development," EASO said. "Venezuelan nationals had never lodged such a high number of applications in a single month ever before."There were 3,995 Venezuelans who applied in February, up 51% from January and nearly triple the figure a year ago, EASO added.In February, Venezuela saw a worsening of a political, economic and humanitarian crisis resulting from the contested re-election of President Nicolas Maduro.EASO said Syrians, who have been fleeing the eight-year civil war, lodged some 5,393 applications, slightly fewer than in January. Afghan applications decreased to December 2018 levels, even if the number was up 31% from a year ago.EASO said 1,937 Colombians, 731 Salvadorans, 616 Nicaraguans and 592 Hondurans filed for asylum in February. There were also 351 requests from citizens of Haiti, 323 from Peru, 112 from Cuba and 73 from Guatemala.Most, it said, are seeking to live in Spain.EAS0 said the Colombian applications also amounted to a record high, up 47% from January and more than triple the number from a year earlier.Colombia now ranks tenth in the nationalities seeking asylum in Europe.The number of Nicaraguan applicants also increased sharply, from just nine in February 2018, to 616 in February this year.In 2015, the European Union faced its worst migration crisis since World War II, with more than one million people entering the bloc from Syria and other countries in the Middle East and Africa.The EU has sharply cut the migration flow through cooperation with Turkey and Libya, which have been staging areas for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.

                                        ADDIS ABABA - The African Union on Monday threatened to suspend Sudan following last week's coup that saw Omar al-Bashir ousted by the military after nearly three decades in power.If the junta fails to hand power to civilians within 15 days, the AU will suspend "the participation of the Sudan in all AU's activities until the restoration of constitutional order," the body's Peace and Security Council (PSC) said in a statement.Bashir ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 30 years before he was deposed last week following mass protests that have rocked the country since December.The protesters have remained in the streets, demanding a return to civilian rule from the military council that's replaced Bashir.The AU echoed the protesters' demands, calling the military intervention a "coup d'Etat, which (the PSC) strongly condemns."The body, which has 55 member states, added that "a military-led transition would be completely contrary to the aspirations of the people of Sudan."

The month of April does bring the NFL draft, but before any of that happens offseason workouts get going across the league. A few weeks after several teams got going, the Dallas Cowboys’ began today. The workouts can be used as a tone setter for the bulk of the team and it is a potential spot for anyone looking for a new contract to begin holding out.Among those in attendance was running back Ezekiel Elliott. Some news outlets had floated the idea Elliott could hold out and stay away from team activities as he seeks a contract extension. Just like he has been through his first three years, he was there on time with no issues. The practices are voluntary, but many teams usually have some of their contract tied to players showing up to the offseason workouts like this one.The Cowboys have the reverse dynamic in play: Zack Martin, Tyron Smith, Travis Frederick, Tyrone Crawford, La'el Collins, Allen Hurns and Sean Lee all have a $500K de-escalator clause in their contracts for not participating in offseason workouts. https://t.co/MMVJzSBq24— Field Yates (@FieldYates) April 15, 2019There are three phases to offseason workouts, with this one lasting two weeks and where the only interaction with team officials are with strength and conditioning coaches. After the two weeks, then comes phase two which is more or less a teaching session for three weeks, then the final phase which involves team activities.The sessions are limited per the CBA to 90 minutes.While a large number of players have been at The Star working out for the last month, the Cowboys officially start Phase 1 of their offseason program today in which they can work out with the strength and conditioning coaches for the next two weeks…. https://t.co/OUjS0XPu7B— Todd Archer (@toddarcher) April 15, 2019Now that superstar defensive end Demarcus Lawrence got his gigantic bag full of money, that story no longer has any legs to run with, but it is interesting to see who shows up to these programs. Thankfully one of the people that there was a slight concern on showing, Ezekiel Elliott, did in fact show up and was ready to work.In case you didn't believe all of the reports that Zeke was showing up to the offseason program he posted it on Instagram too pic.twitter.com/gfuuiBJ8GZ— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) April 15, 2019Elliott is on the fourth year of his rookie deal, but with being a first-round pick (No. 4 overall in 2016), the team has a fifth-year option that they will likely exercise before the deadline the first week of May.You can follow Ryan Welch on Twitter @Rywelch.

                                        INDIANA - Pete Buttigieg, the millennial-aged mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has enjoyed a surge in opinion polls and a torrent of media coverage, formally launched a bid on Sunday for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.“It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different,” he said at a launch event in South Bend.No potential contender in the burgeoning Democratic field has seen as rapid a rise in the early stages of the campaign as Buttigieg, who has gone from obscure Midwestern politician to top-tier contender in a matter of weeks.At 37, Buttigieg becomes the youngest entrant in a field that features 77-year-old US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and, likely soon, 76-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden - a contrast Buttigieg has embraced.“I recognise the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor,” he told the crowd.“More than a little bold —at age 37 — to seek the highest office in the land.”The man known as “Mayor Pete” has styled himself as the voice of the millennial generation, often talking about what the United States might look like decades from now.“I take that long view because I have to,” Buttigieg said. “I come from that generation that grew up with school shootings as the norm, the generation that produced the bulk of the troops in the post-9/11 conflicts, the generation that is going to be on the business end of climate change for as long as we live.”Buttigieg is the first openly gay major presidential candidate, which has given him inroads into a Democratic base that increasingly values diversity and progressivism.I just announced I'm running for president of the United States. Join in and donate if you can. It's going to be an amazing ride and I can't wait to be on it with you all the way to the White House: https://t.co/edZnUvfc2I pic.twitter.com/OTi0YsAG5RDuring the event, he frequently mentioned his husband, Chasten, and spoke of the struggle to legalise same-sex marriage.“Our marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the US Supreme Court,” he said.As mayor of South Bend since 2012, he has presided over an economic turnaround that has brought new investment into the struggling northwestern Indiana industrial town, an achievement likely to be a central plank of his presidential campaign.Indeed, his kick-off event was held inside the cavernous former plant that once made Studebaker autos. It closed in 1963 and only now is being redeveloped.Polls of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire released last week showed Buttigieg in third place in both early-voting states, although still well behind Biden and Sanders. Buttigieg raised $7 million in the first quarter of the year, surpassing more established rivals such as US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.More than a dozen Democrats have announced a run for the chance to take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 general election. Democratic voters will begin the process of selecting a nominee in a series of contests beginning early next year.A former Rhodes Scholar, consultant for the firm McKinsey and Co and US Navy reservist who served in Afghanistan, Buttigieg has the kind of background that could appeal to both moderates and progressives in the party.But questions will persist about whether the mayor of an Indiana city of 100,000 residents is ready to run a nation of 330 million.

                                            The German case comes nearly a year after the United States filed charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German carmaker’s emissions cheating.

                                        FRANKFURT/BERLIN - German prosecutors charged former Volkswagen  boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud on Monday over his role in the carmaker’s manipulation of diesel emissions testing, more than three years after the scandal came to light.The German case comes nearly a year after the United States filed charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German carmaker’s emissions cheating.The prosecutors office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement that Winterkorn and four other managers faced charges. It did not give the names of the other four or say whether they were still employed by Volkswagen.Winterkorn’s lawyer, Felix Doerr, said he could not comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.A spokesman for Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the scandal came to light and said at the time he was stunned by the scale of misconduct, did not respond to a request for comment.Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat US pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel and costing the carmaker 29 billion euros so far ($33 billion).Volkswagen’s current chief executive Herbert Diess, who only joined the carmaker in July 2015 and became CEO a year ago, said he was not among those charged.“I am not among the accused. I do not expect to be charged,” Diess said, speaking on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show.The events took place between November 2006 and September 2015, the prosecutors said, adding that Winterkorn had failed in his duty to inform European and US authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated.“Former Chief Executive Dr. Martin Winterkorn is being charged with a particularly serious case of fraud, a violation of the law against unfair competition and breach of fiduciary trust,” the prosecutors’ office said in a statement.He also neglected to inform customers of the illegal software and did not prevent the continued installation of such software, the prosecutors alleged.They added that this had resulted in Volkswagen being slapped with much higher fines in Germany and the United States than would have been the case had he acted.Criminal proceedings against the carmaker over the rigged tests had already resulted in a one billion euro fine in June last year, marking one of the highest ever punitive payments imposed by German authorities against a company.Volkswagen said it would not comment because the company was not a party to the proceedings against individuals and that the Braunschweig criminal case against the company itself had been closed.While Winterkorn has already been charged by US authorities, he remains in Germany, which does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in US courts.In a related case, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Winterkorn last month, saying US investors were informed too late about the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, alleging “massive fraud”.The Braunschweig prosecutors said people accused of particularly serious fraud could face up to 10 years in prison in Germany.Alongside Winterkorn, four more managers were being charged on counts including major fraud and unfair competition, the statement said.They said that investigations into another 36 suspects in the diesel emissions scandal were ongoing and it was unclear when they would be wrapped up.

Chief selector MSK Prasad explains why India picked Dinesh Karthik over Rishabh Pant as the backup keeper (1:20)There was no place for Rishabh Pant or Ambati Rayudu in India's 15-man World Cup squad, but KL Rahul, Dinesh Karthik, Vijay Shankar and Ravindra Jadeja got the selectors' nod.The meeting to pick the team took place in Mumbai on Monday and was attended by India captain Virat Kohli and the five-man selection panel led by MSK Prasad.The squad: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma (vice capt), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Vijay Shankar, MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami.Who will be the No. 4?For the past few months, both Kohli and Prasad had stressed that the World Cup squad was virtually "sorted" barring one spot: The No. 4 spot in the batting order. India have tried as many as 11 batsmen in that position since the 2017 Champions Trophy held in England.Kohli wants a No. 4 batsman with both the skill and temperament to inject momentum into the innings, especially if India are setting a target. Ambati Rayudu, Pant, Vijay and Karthik emerged as the main contenders for the spot and the selectors have now shortlisted Vijay, Karthik, Kedar Jadhav and if need be Rahul to perform that important role."After that Champions Trophy [in 2017] we have tried quite a few middle-order batsmen, which also includes Dinesh Karthik; we also tried Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey. We did give a few more chances to Rayudu, but what Vijay Shankar offers is three dimensions. Apart from his batting, he can bowl; if the conditions are suitable, overcast, which we might encounter in England, he might bowl a bit and he's a fantastic fielder. That's the thing that went in favour of Vijay Shankar."We are looking at him at No. 4 to begin with. With Dinesh Karthik in and also Kedar Jadhav in, we have plenty of options at that No. 4 right now."India's vice-captain Rohit Sharma had also put forward MS Dhoni's name at No. 4, although he insisted it was a "personal" choice. Prasad said that they had looked at all options in the meeting and the unanimous decision was to stick with Shankar at No. 4, at least at the start of the World Cup."It (Dhoni at No. 4) was discussed," Prasad said. "But I don't think that was the point. The point discussed is that Vijay Shankar will bat at No. 4 and so can Kedar Jadhav and we also have a role for KL [Rahul] somewhere." Prasad clarified that Rahul would be the third opener and will only be brought into the middle order if all other options failed.Karthik v PantWhy Karthik and not Pant was a question directed at Prasad more than once at the media briefing. And Prasad explained that though Pant was "almost there", the selectors had more faith in Karthik handling the pressure of "crunch" matches."It's definitely a case where we have debated at length and all of us in unison felt that either Rishabh Pant or DK [Karthik] will only come into the playing XI if Mahi [Dhoni] is injured. If it is a crucial match, like a quarter-final or a semi-final or like an important game, wicketkeeping also matters. So that's the only reason that we went ahead with Dinesh Karthik. Otherwise Rishabh Pant was almost there."However, the biggest factor that worked against Pant was his struggle in finishing games for Delhi Capitals in IPL 2019; something that had also happened in final ODI against Australia in March, when he walked in to bat early with India chasing 273, but fell for a run-a-ball 16."That is exactly what we have discussed," Prasad said. "Under pressure, we have seen Dinesh Karthik finishing matches. That's one reason that scored for him."Despite his promise as a hard-hitting batsman, Pant's wicketkeeping has not convinced everybody - including Prasad. "You can say that, you can say that, but the situation that was discussed among the selection committee is one of them will play in the XI provided MS [Dhoni] is injured. So under such situations, in crunch matches, who is the best guy who can handle the pressure? That is the reason that we went in favour of Dinesh Karthik. Otherwise Pant is full of talent. We have a lot of time for him. It is just unfortunate that he has missed out."Three spinners against fourth specialist fast bowlerThe defending champions Australia announced their World Cup squad on the same day as India and they picked as many as five fast bowlers. India though have settled for only three - Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami.It appears that the fourth seamer's spot has gone to Jadeja, who has been included in case the wristspinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal suffer drops in form, which can happen in a tournament like the World Cup where each team plays nine games during the league phase alone."In the last one-and-a-half years, these two wristspinners who have won us games," Prasad said. "But there might be a situation where you might require an additional allrounder in the playing XI, which Jadeja brings in. In the second part of the tournament, where the wickets may be a bit more dry, that is where we felt Jadeja will come in handy. That's the reason why he's been picked."Also, the selectors believe that with four allrounders in the squad - including Hardik Pandya and Vijay, who bowl seam up - India can often field an XI with as many as seven strong bowling options. Also, a BCCI press release said four additional quicks - Navdeep Saini, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed and Deepak Chahar - will be traveling to the UK "to assist the Indian team in their World Cup preparation" and they could well be on standby in case of any problems to the three frontline quicks.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?Who will make India's 15 for the World Cup?

Rodgers Ssekawoko Muhumuza, left, checked Owamani Bruce for pneumonia with a portable ultrasound scanner in the Kabale district in western Uganda.CreditCreditSupported byBy Donald G. McNeil Jr.Photographs by Esther Ruth MbabaziBUSHORO, Uganda — Lying on a church pew with his arm over his head, 6-year-old Gordon Andindagaye whimpered a bit — in fear, not pain — as Dr. William A. Cherniak slowly swept a small ultrasound scanner up and down his chest.Dr. Cherniak and Rodgers Ssekawoko Muhumuza, the Ugandan clinical officer he was training, stared at the iPhone into which the scanner was plugged, watching Gordon’s lung expand and contract.“O.K.,” Dr. Cherniak finally said. “What do you recommend?”Gordon had a persistent cough and swollen lymph nodes, and looked tired and unwell. As other boys ran around outside, kicking a soccer ball made of rags and twine, he clung weakly to his mother. The scan on the iPhone’s screen suggested his lungs had fluid in them.As Dr. Cherniak nodded approval, Mr. Muhumuza prescribed an antibiotic, and ordered blood tests to rule out tuberculosis, malaria and H.I.V. He arranged for Gordon and his mother to get a ride to a local clinic for an X-ray and a night of observation.Dr. Cherniak, an emergency medicine specialist from Canada, said he would upload the scan that evening so an ultrasound specialist in Toronto could double-check the diagnosis: early-stage pneumonia.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The diagnosis was made possible by a new invention that Dr. Cherniak hopes will revolutionize front-line global medicine: a hand-held ultrasound scanner called the Butterfly iQ.The Butterfly is about the size of an electric shaver. It is battery-powered and contains microchips rather than piezoelectric crystals, so it usually won’t break if dropped. (That was accidentally tested a few times during a week that a reporter spent in rural Uganda with Dr. Cherniak’s team.)For Butterfly Network, the Connecticut company that makes it, the profitable target customers are doctors and nurses who can afford a $2,000 device that fits in a coat pocket and is as portable as a stethoscope.But the scanner also has huge potential in rural Africa, Asia and Latin America, where the nearest X-ray machine may be hours away and the only CT and MRI scanners may be in the nation’s capital.“That was my real motivation for making it,” said Jonathan Rothberg, Butterfly’s founder, who initially pursued the goal because one of his daughters had a disease that caused kidney cysts needing regular scans. “Two-thirds of the world’s population gets no imaging at all,” he added. “When you put something on a chip, the price goes down and you democratize it.”The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of his backers, as are the investment arms of other family philanthropies.“My team is engineers and computer scientists,” he said. “We’d love to be able to save lives the way doctors do, but we can’t — so every tweet from Africa about the Butterfly is an incredible adrenaline shot for us.”He has donated scanners to medical charities working in 13 low-income countries, seven of them in Africa. Several went to Bridge to Health, a Canadian charity that Dr. Cherniak founded six years ago; it works closely with Kihefo, a medical charity based in western Uganda.For now, the scanners are primarily used to check for pneumonia, which is a major killer of children in poor countries and is frequently misdiagnosed. But Dr. Cherniak’s team has found other fascinating uses for the devices — which they deployed under conditions almost as stark and dusty as those found in battlefield medicine.Kihefo runs what might be described as a traveling medical circus. Each day at dawn, its roustabouts drive a truck loaded with collapsible tents into a different village and erect them on whatever flat ground they find — perhaps a patch of goat-gnawed grass between the school and the church.To improvise examination tables, they borrow the wooden school desks and church pews, pad them with yoga mats and screen them with thin purple curtains.An hour later, the Canadian-Ugandan “brigade” rolls in — vans full of doctors, nurses, dentists, chiropractors, gynecologists, ophthalmologists and pharmacists, accompanied by local clinical officers and medical students, all toting huge bags of equipment. (Yes, hockey bags — it’s a Canadian charity.)While the dental team fills cavities and the ophthalmologists check eyes, the medical team sees one patient after another, from newborns to nonagenarians.On a recent visit to this village, the doctors used their Butterflies not just to screen for pneumonia, but to scan other organs. Checking a large goiter on the neck of a 42-year-old woman, they learned that it was pressing on her windpipe, meaning she would soon need surgery, even though she had no breathing problems yet.They scanned the lungs of a frighteningly emaciated baby to see if she had tuberculosis. They scanned the swollen testicle of a 54-year-old man and determined that he probably had cancer rather than their first tentative diagnosis — fluid draining from worm-infested lymph glands.Scanning the abdomen of a child with a penis birth defect, they learned that his urine was backing up, threatening him with kidney damage — a problem that a simple operation could correct. They scanned a lump in the chest of a 96-year-old man and concluded that it was probably not cancerous because it lacked blood vessels. Particularly challenging was the case of a 51-year-old woman with a lump on her neck. In part because she described a long history of what sounded like tuberculosis, they initially suspected scrofula.(Scrofula — once called “the King’s Evil” because medieval monarchs claimed to cure it by touch — is caused by TB bacteria clumping under the skin. )“I went to a healer who stabbed me with fire,” the woman said, describing a traditional method for draining an abscess: heating a knife in a fire and plunging it into the lump. It hurt a lot and healed nothing, she said.Scanning the lump, Dr. Cherniak saw that it had veins, meaning it was not an abscess and appeared to be attached to a blood vessel.“See it pulsing away?” he said to his trainee as they looked at his phone. “You don’t want to go anywhere near that. If I did a biopsy, it could bleed a lot. Now I know not to muck around with it and get her to a surgeon.”Some cases remained mysterious. A knotty lump in a 70-year-old woman’s thigh seemed to be neither a tumor, cyst, abscess nor fat deposit. Dr. Cherniak’s best guess was that it was the broken-off tip of a stick she said she had been stabbed with decades earlier.Through a translator, he explained that he could remove it surgically, but the procedure would be painful and the wound might get infected.“It’s like a bullet you leave if it’s safer to not remove it,” he said.She decided to live with it.Even more mystifying was a woman who appeared to be over 70 but whose belly was so swollen that she looked pregnant. Doctor after doctor tried scanning her; the gallons of fluid in her abdomen had shoved her organs far from their customary places. Surprisingly, her liver seemed normal — doctors initially had guessed the swelling resulted from alcoholic cirrhosis. But no one could find her spleen. “What if it’s ALL spleen?” Dr. Cherniak mused. “Could it really get that big?”Various theories — a blocked liver vein, lesions from a sand-fly parasite, a mucus-emitting tumor — were discussed. Finally, all agreed that she needed further scans that only a hospital could do.The Butterfly’s diagnostic potential is enormous, Kihefo’s founder, Dr. Geoffrey Anguyo, said enthusiastically: “But the question is, how much training is adequate?”Learning to interpret the fuzzy black-and-white images on a cellphone screen and recognize all the organs, blood vessels, valves and whatnot inside the body — and to do it well enough to spot tumors and other anomalies — is a skill that can take months to learn.The Gates Foundation, Dr. Rothberg said, is writing software intended to guide untrained users as they scan. For now, Bridge to Health is focusing on teaching Kihefo’s clinical officers, who get up to four years medical training but are not physicians, to diagnose pneumonia.Success will be achieved, Dr. Anguyo and Dr. Cherniak agreed, when the officers’ diagnoses agree with those of the ultrasound specialists in Toronto at least 80 percent of the time.That’s where another aspect of the Butterfly comes in handy: iPhones make it easy to upload scans to the internet.In Gordon’s case, a Canadian reviewer confirmed the diagnosis but said Mr. Muhumuza needed to improve his technique by holding the scanner at a sharper angle and setting it to project sound waves deeper. Five years ago, Bridge to Health and Kihefo jointly pioneered another imaginative use for ultrasound.Knowing how hard it is to convince rural women to visit doctors early in their pregnancies, they acquired some portable briefcase-sized scanners and then aired radio ads announcing where Kihefo would set up next the next morning. “You will be able to see your unborn baby,” they promised.Attendance at their antenatal clinics shot up sixfold, and women who had previously seen only traditional healers began coming in.That was important because doctors could offer many kinds of care. Problems that can kill a mother or baby can be detected and prevented early in pregnancy, including H.I.V., syphilis, vitamin deficiencies and high blood pressure.The success of that program “was how we were able to get support from U.S.A.I.D.,” said Dr. Anguyo, referring to the United States Agency for International Development.“U.S.A.I.D. was looking for unique ways to check women aged 15 to 30 for H.I.V., and we had a very good ‘trap’ for catching those women,” he said.Now, with American grants for the war on AIDS shrinking, Kihefo is hunting for new ways to raise money. One new project, Dr. Anguyo said, helps local farmers switch from raising chickens to raising rabbits. Rabbits eat grass, which costs nothing, so the profit margin is greater than for chickens, which need corn.Kihefo encourages its farmers to eat some rabbits for protein and sell the rest to pay their national health insurance premiums.Better pneumonia diagnosis can also slow the overprescription of antibiotics, which hastens the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Of the 91 children with fevers and coughs the team scanned in a week, only one in the village — Gordon — had confirmed pneumonia.That, Dr. Cherniak surmised, was probably because modern vaccines against pneumonia-causing bacteria are working well.All the children got antibiotics anyway, because Ugandan national medical protocols require a prescription for every child with high fever and cough. That’s common in poor countries, where it is often impossible to get confirmatory X-rays. (Kihefo’s only X-ray machine, for example, is closed down because the charity cannot afford to build lead walls around it.)Eventually, if ultrasound gains acceptance, the national protocols should change. “If a clinical officer can say, ‘It’s viral, you can go home,’” Dr. Cherniak said, “you can decrease those wrong prescriptions.”For Gordon, the prompt diagnosis worked out: a visit to the Kihefo clinic 24 hours after he started his antibiotics found him sitting up in bed, smiling and feeling much better.Donald G.

Sports. The outdoors. A big family. Great grades. All of these factors influenced Joe Henley in his formative years growing up in Loudonville. However, Henley, one of the top 10 academic students in this year’s senior class with a 3.88 academic average, has chosen business as his career field as he takes his next step, going to college at the University of Akron. "I worked the past two summers at the Go Karts at Mohican Adventures, and I found, on the job, that I really enjoyed dealing with people," he said. "I think I would be happy and successful in a business career that centers on dealing with people." His summer job at Mohican Adventures also influenced his college choice. "A couple of guys I worked with go there and told me the programs there are awesome, and I confirmed that in my studies of various college. Akron has an outstanding business program." Henley’s favorite subjects at LHS were the biological sciences. "I really enjoyed Mr. David Spreng’s Biology II class because of the outdoor work we did in it, like taxonomy," he said. "In fact, I have always enjoyed doing things outdoors." He also loves sports. At LHS, Henley has earned four letters in basketball and baseball, three in soccer, and one in football, and commented, "of the sports, I think I like basketball the best, even though I am not as good at it as baseball." Henley also grew up in a big family, as the fifth of six children of Chuck and Rita Henley of Loudonville. His eldest sister, Lauren Davis, 34, is a teacher in Columbus; Twila Soles, 33, who lives in Colorado and is a craft beer brewer; Will, 22, also in Columbus where he drives truck for Amazon; Liz, 20, who recently graduated from college at the Bradford School in Columbus; and James, 14, an eighth-grader. Asked if any individual had a major influence on his life, he immediately mentioned his older brother Will. "We were very close when we were younger, and he taught me to play, and enjoy, all sports," he said. At LHS, he cited social studies teacher Eric Stoner as the most influential. "I took a college level politics class from him, and learned a lot about politics and government, and in the process, he shared a lot of knowledge and experience about a lot of other subjects," Henley said. Last year, as a junior, he took four College Credit Plus courses, two math and two social studies, but this year he is sticking just with LHS classes. "Among them this year are calculus and physics, both pretty tough classes," he said. In addition to all the sports, Henley is a member of the high school’s Leo Club and the National Honor Society. He was captain of the basketball team this year, and is a member of St. Peter Catholic Church.

Credit:APBut even after Thursday's release substantial portions of the report are likely to remain shielded from public view.Barr has said he will redact four specific categories of information from the version of the report he releases to the public.These categories are:Following the release of the redacted version of the report, Democrats will call on Barr to testify before a congressional hearing. They are also considering subpoenaing Mueller himself to appear to Congress to explain his findings.Matthew Knott is a journalist for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age based in the United States.Copyright © 2019Tiger Woods' improbable Masters victory will reward the few companies that stuck with him through his struggles, along with the ones that joined him when he was near the low point of his career.The 43-year-old won his fifth Masters title on Sunday by one stroke. It's his first major victory in over a decade and just his second PGA Tour victory in more than five years.Tiger Woods' victory at Augusta was lucrative for Nike. Credit:APIt's also a win for his sponsors. During the final-round telecast, when he made a late charge, he generated more than $US23.6 million in exposure for various corporate partners, according to sponsorship analytics firm Apex Marketing Group. Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing executive at Baker Street Advertising, cited Woods's ability to bring even casual fans to their televisions."He moves the needle like no other golfer does or ever has done," Dorfman said, comparing Woods' legendary status to that of Michael Jordan. "Nobody can do what he does and it's amazing he's been able to do it for as long as he has."Woods' return to the center of golf's biggest stage will probably drive added interest in pro golf for a while and generate even more attention for his corporate partners. It will also renew debate over whether a healthy Woods can regain the dominance of his early career, when he single-handedly boosted golf's status around the world.Woods now has 15 major titles, three shy of Jack Nicklaus' record 18.In the moments after Woods' final putt on Sunday, longtime sponsor Nike released a video congratulating him on the feat, and highlighting his push to pass Nicklaus. The video uses audio from a 3-year-old Woods listing his golf aspirations."To think a 43-year-old who has experienced every high and every low, and has just won his 15th major, is chasing the same dream as a 3-year-old," the video says.No company is more closely associated with Woods than Nike, which signed him when he turned pro back in 1996 and built its golf business around his stardom. Woods was once making $US30 million a year from Nike, according to Forbes, but in 2016 the company announced it would stop making golf clubs, balls and bags. Nike is still Woods's apparel partner - the red Nike shirt he wore on Sunday is a familiar sight to most fans - but over the past few years Woods has had to look elsewhere for ball and club partners.Nike shares rose as much as 1.2 per cent to $US87.24 in New York trading Monday. The effect extended to golf brands unconnected to Woods: Callaway Golf gained as much as 4.1 per cent, while Titleist parent Acushnet Holdings Corp. was up as much as 4.2 per cent.During a decade when Woods's life was marred by marital trouble, substance abuse, multiple surgeries and inconsistent play, many of the other brands associated with the former star either dropped him outright or failed to renew their partnerships. They included AT&T, Gillette, Buick and watchmaker Tag Heuer.In their place is a new stable of partners. Monster Energy has been branding Woods's bag since 2016. TaylorMade is now his club sponsor; Bridgestone makes his golf balls. There are also smaller deals with Hero MotoCorp, an Indian motorcycle maker, and Kowa, a Japanese pharmaceutical company. Several of them sought to capitalise on the moment, with Monster Energy musing what a tiger's favored color might be.Tiger Woods was once making $US30 million a year from Nike, according to Forbes, but that number has dwindled in recent years.Credit:APWoods carried 13 TaylorMade clubs on Sunday, according to Chief Executive Officer David Abeles. While the Masters win is great for the golf business overall, and it's good for sales when fans see Woods win tournaments using TaylorMade clubs, Woods has helped the privately owned brand in another major way."He's been heavily involved in our research and development functions, and heavily involved in our product creation," Abeles said. "He has one of the most incredible perspectives on product technology of any athlete we've ever worked with."Abeles, who declined to provide financial details of the agreement with Woods, said TaylorMade has already seen a boost in interest following the Masters. Phone volume on Monday morning was three times heavier than it was last week, and website traffic after the Masters was double what it was after the tournament last year.During Sunday's final round telecast on CBS, Woods's prominent placement was a boon to many of those brands. Nike saw $US22.5 million in exposure, according to Apex. Monster received $US960,000, while Bridgestone saw $US134,000. Those numbers will increase as highlights and print media push images of Woods's win across the globe. They'll also jump at later tournaments that receive a Woods boost in viewership and attention.At the height of his career, Woods was making $US110 million per year as the world's highest paid athlete, including that $US30 million from Nike, according to Forbes. Last year the magazine reported his earnings as $US43.3 million.For now, Woods sounded bewildered at his resurrection to top-dog status."I'm kind of at a loss for words," Woods said after the win. "It's overwhelming because of what has transpired."BloombergCopyright © 2019APThe Minnesota Twins host the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday night.
