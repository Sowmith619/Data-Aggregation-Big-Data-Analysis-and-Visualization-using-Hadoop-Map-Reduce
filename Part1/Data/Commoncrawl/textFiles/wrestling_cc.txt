One of the most underutilized and misused Superstar on the current roster has to be Shinsuke Nakamura. Although, a former US Champion and winner of the Royal Rumble, it would be safe to say that Nakamura has not been used to his full potential in WWE.There had been a lot of speculation regarding Nakamura's future in the WWE, as it was alleged that The Rockstar is not happy with his state in WWE and may not re-sign his contract when it is up.However, as per recent reports, the truth seems entirely different.Shinsuke Nakamura started his pro-wrestling career in 2002 in Japan. He rose through the ranks in Japan and finally captured the coveted IWGP World Championship in NJPW. He also held various other championships like the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and IWGP Tag Team Championships during his stay in NJPW.The Artist made his debut in WWE as part of NXT in 2016, and was able to capture the NXT Championship as well.However, his run on the main roster has been sub-par, and even though he has had a series of great matches, the 39-year-old has failed to break through.Also Read: When former WWE Champion physically attacked Vince McMahon on a flightWhile there was speculation that Nakamura may be planning to jump ship and join AEW, those rumors may not hold any truth.Dave Meltzer responded to a fan asking if Shinsuke was staying with WWE or leaving, and Meltzer stated that he is staying.Staying https://t.co/RRFw24I3T8Shinsuke Nakamura is currently paired with Rusev on SmackDown and the two have become an important part of the Tag Team division.Do you think it is wise for Nakamura to continue with WWE?Also Read: WWE adds a major stipulation in The Undertaker's new contractBy Tim Collins For Mailonline  Published: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019   4View  commentsMore than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland.An international research team traced more than ten generations in the same grave.They said their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.More than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.  Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland. This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Sweden sequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe. The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland. The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmström, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths. Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.

A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia. These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and the level of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

He had a spinal fusion surgery in 2017.That same year, he faced charges for driving under the influence.Woods' personal life, and career, had already been on the decline before the back surgery and DUI charge when years before his ongoing cheating was brought to light.  Woods won the Gene Serazen Cup in 2013 at the Cadillac Championship golf tournament at Trump National Dural in Florida. Trump is an avid golfer and often spends his free time on the courseWoods' last Masters win before Sunday was in 2005, 14 years agoWoods met his now-former wife Elin Nordegren in 2001, and they had two children.In 2009 the chronic cheating went public when the National Enquirer published a story outlining his relationship with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub hostess.  Woods also had a relationship with cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs. Other than his two mistresses, Woods also reportedly had unprotected sex with porn starts. Following the scandals Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors of Woods lost billions of dollars collectively, and some dropped him completely. At the time, Woods released a statement saying he was 'taking an indefinite leave from golf to work on saving his marriage,' and wanted to focus 'on being a better husband, father, and person.' Woods had a few good seasons upon returning to golf after news of the affairs simmered, but never had another big win until this weekend. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Emily Crane For Dailymail.com  Published: 15:38 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 20:38 EDT, 15 April 2019   38View  commentsThe bodies of two young women who were found dead in a Texas oil field that was dubbed the infamous Killing Fields have finally been identified after 30 years following a breakthrough in forensic DNA analysis.Police on Monday identified the two women as Audrey Lee Cook, from Memphis, Tennessee, and Donna Prudhomme, from Port Arthur, Texas.Cook was found in 1986 and Prudhomme was discovered in 1991. The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside Houston. Police on Monday identified the two women Audrey Lee Cook, (left) from Memphis, Tennessee, and Donna Prudhomme, (right) from Port Arthur, Texas. Cook was found in 1986 and Prudhomme was discovered in 1991Their bodies were uncovered in the same location where two other previously identified women were murdered and dumped. Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.  Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe. Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women. Cook, who born in 1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found. She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985. Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine. Prudhomme, who was born in 1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed. The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered. Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine. Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved. Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 15:43 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:24 EDT, 15 April 2019   724View  commentsThe world stood helpless as Notre Dame burned on Monday and hundreds of French fire fighters worked to put out the blaze. As they battled the flames, world leaders and celebrities took to social media in shock to share their sadness and disbelief. They likened the gut-wrenching images and videos of the cathedral's crumbling spire to like watching 'someone you love die'. United in their sadness, here are some of their reactions.Fire fighters continue to battle the flames at the Notre Dame in Paris, hours after a fire broke out   Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Jessica Green and Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline and David Churchill and Peter Allen In Paris For The Daily Mail  Published: 15:34 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 01:11 EDT, 16 April 2019   1kView  commentsThe French Interior Ministry said 400 firefighters were mobilised to help tackle the blaze that engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday.And while hundreds of comments flooded the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters, many questions were raised as to how the fire was dealt with.Did fire crews react quickly enough? The Paris fire chief last night paid tribute to his crews, saying they had saved the cathedral from total destruction.Commander Jean-Claude Gallet said a major accomplishment of hundreds of firefighters was stopping the flames from spreading to the north tower belfry.The ministry said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze He said two-thirds of Notre Dame's roofing 'has been ravaged' and one firefighter was injured. Fire crews will keep working overnight to cool down the structure, Mr Gallet added.However, there was criticism that the fire service had not responded quickly enough – and didn't seem to have the right equipment to tackle such a large blaze.Flames appeared to be raging inside the cathedral for a long time before water jets capable of stopping them were mobilised.Were the fire crews well-equipped enough to deal with the flames?Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a height. Last night, the French interior ministry tried to defend the response – insisting that 400 firemen had been deployed.The ministry suggested that aircraft were not used because it was feared that the weight of water falling at such a height could cause large parts of the cathedral to collapse.Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a heightIn an online statement it said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze.However, pictures appeared to show that this was the only one of its kind and residents questioned why more pressure hoses and cherry-picker cranes were not on site to be able to douse the flames from above as they took hold of the scaffolding and the roof near to the spire.As the blaze raged, the Paris authorities insisted that getting fire teams to the top of the building 'was almost impossible'.'It's much too high up, and the only access is stone and spiral staircases,' said an emergency services source. 'This means that the fire has been able to spread across the roof.'Jets of water are seen desperately trying to extinguish the flames engulfing Notre DameLocal resident Michel Dupont said those living around the cathedral were upset more equipment was not on site to spray water at the flames high up. 'A lot of us are asking questions about the authorities' response,' he said.Liz Boeder, another Parisian, said 'we need California firefighters', in reference to the water-carrying aircraft used to tackle the forest fires in the US last year. Others who watched the blaze unfold on live TV also raised questions.Kent Ardleb said: 'What a tragedy. Notre Dame cathedral is lost. Where is the damn fire brigade?'Another posted: 'How come there aren't any fire fighters or water jets to be seen on any photos!?'Dave Pasin said: 'It seems there are no firefighters to be seen, no water, nothing?'The French Interior Ministry has mobilised 400 firefighters to help tackle the inferno that has been burning for hours Why did the fire brigade not drop water on the Notre Dame Cathedral?Authorities have revealed they were unable to drop water on the landmark to tame the blaze for fear it would ruin what was left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.French news site Le Monde, explained: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.Firefighters look at the fire at the landmark Notre Dame Cathedral in central Paris as they cross a bridge over the Seine river'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.' What caused the blaze to spread so quickly?The roof structure is made entirely in timber, with each beam being made from a single oak tree in a tight lattice – which may be the key to understanding last night's disaster. In all, 5,000 oaks were used in making it.Using innovative architectural techniques to assert France's growing status as a European power, its soaring vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses and doors surmounted by a row of figures of Old Testament kings were an expression of royal grandeur.The building is longer than a football pitch at 427ft, with its largely wooden spire – which collapsed on Monday – once soaring 300ft into the Parisian sky. The sheer amount of wood and its grand scale both worked against it when the blaze took hold. A picture taken less than a month ago shows a scaffold during the restoration of Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, in Paris'It makes sense that it would be incredibly flammable,' explained Notre Dame contributor Daniel Christian on the website for the landmark.The structure's aging wooden frame has long been a topic of concern, and a $6.8million renovation project was underway to address some of the many issues at the historic building.But as the fire 'started near the spire, where the scaffolding is,' it has been suggested that the renovation work sparked the flames.Officials have not yet determined if this was the case. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Laura Collins, Chief Investigative Reporter For Dailymail.com  Published: 15:22 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 16:16 EDT, 15 April 2019   2View  commentsA wealthy New York investment advisor is being sued for more than $5million by his ex-girlfriend who claims he assaulted and humiliated her on a trip to Jamaica earlier this year, in a violent outburst that has left her struggling with PTSD.Yale educated Matthew Ram Shannon Lee, 45, is co-founder and partner of the Manhattan based investment advisor firm, Seven Bridges Advisors, which currently manages a staggering $5billion worth of assets.Lee met Jenna Bickelmann, 33, a buyer for fashion store, Milly, through The League an exclusive dating app with membership plans costing up to $999 a month.The app - whose name is a nod to Ivy League - bills itself as a 'dating and social networking community' whose members share the common thread of 'ambition and a drive to succeed.' Jenna Bickelmann, 33, is suing Matthew Ram Shannon Lee, 45, for $5million over claims he physically and emotionally abused her during their months-long relationship, leaving her with PTSDLee is co-founder and partner of the Manhattan based investment advisor firm, Seven Bridges Advisors, which currently manages $5billion worth of assetsAccording to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com the couple met in person in September 2018.Three months later, on December 29, Lee invited Bickelmann to join him on a business trip to Charleston, South Carolina where he was attending conferences at the elite, invite-only Renaissance Weekend.The weekend was one of several organized across the country each year by an organization once co-chaired by Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford.The weekends began almost forty years ago as a four-day house party thrown by former US Ambassador Phil Lader and his wife at their home in Hilton Head Island.Exclusive and discrete they have been attended by Supreme Court Justices, Senators, Members of Congress and Governors, business leaders, astronauts, Olympic athletes, and Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Nobel prizewinners.Lee covered all of Bicklemann's expenses including airfares so she could join him on the trip that spanned New Year's Eve.Guests were encouraged to enjoy Charleston's, 'cocoon of gentility.'That 'gentility' didn't even make it past New Year's Day for Bickelmann and Lee who, she claims, got into 'a heated verbal argument' when she wanted to dine somewhere other than the restaurant he had booked.Despite this, she agreed to join him on a trip to Jamaica later that month. The couple flew out on January 23 and stayed at The Lagoons, a gated community in Montego Bay where a two-bedroom villa can cost up to $15,000 a week.Bickelmann met Lee through exclusive dating app The League in fall 2018 and the couple went on two trips together to South Carolina in December and Jamaica in January 2019On the Jamaica trip, Lee 'violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand,' according to court documents seen by DailyMail.com. Lee is pictured second from the left at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) conference in 2016As before, Lee paid for everything and, as before, things quickly descended into acrimony.On January 25, two days after their arrival, Bicklemann claims, that Lee committed the first of two assaults against her after they got into an argument in a taxicab.Bickelmann, who works as a buyer for fashion store Milly, is suing for damages to recover from 'personal injuries, emotional distress, assault and battery'According to her lawsuit, 'Lee grabbed [her] face with his hand, shoved her backwards away from him into the seat of the taxi cab and called [her] 'a f***ing b****.'Shocked, Bickelmann called a male friend who advised her that Lee's behavior was 'abnormal and that she should leave Jamaica as soon as she could for her own safety.'She told Lee that she wanted to return to New York and he agreed to change her departure flight from January 27 to 26 while he stayed on.Her court filing states that Lee had planned a yacht outing at 1pm on the day of her departure and therefore told her to leave the villa and head to the airport at 12.30pm.When she said she did not want to make the short trip - some fifteen minutes drive - so early as her flight was not until 3.30pm the couple got into an argument over the best way to lock up the villa.Lee didn't want to be late but nor did he want to leave the keys with Bickelmann.According to Bickelmann the verbal argument turned violent when she attempted to leave the patio where they had been arguing and go back inside.She claimed, 'In the midst of removing herself from this argument with [Lee] who was continuously yelling at her in a degrading manner and cursing at her, [Lee] violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand.'The hit was so unexpected and violent, she claims, she lost her balance and fell onto a nearby patio chair.Bickelmann says in the lawsuit that Lee knew she had previously been in an abusive relationship and suffered from TMJ which was made worse by his alleged abuseAfter regaining her balance, her complaint continued, 'she ran to another chair…now in fear of being hit a second time… she began to cry and was in disbelief he struck her.'Bickelmann claimed her face 'began to swell and become very red,' and that she repeatedly stated, 'Ram you just hit me!'Her screams and their shouting were loud enough for a concerned neighbor to call The Lagoons Security who witnessed Lee pull the weeping Bickelmann back into the villa and shut the sliding glass doors.The alleged assault was made all the worse, Bickelmann has claimed, by the fact that Lee knew her to be a victim of domestic violence and that she suffered from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder causing her severe pain in her jaw.She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the alleged assault.DailyMail.com has requested comment from both Lee and Bicklemann's attorney, but have not heard back. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy William Cole For Mailonline  Published: 15:14 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 02:18 EDT, 16 April 2019   54View  commentsThe ruined former-home of a real-life 'Wicker Man' and a legendary guitarist has been put for sale -

Trump tweeted.Trump also tweeted congratulations to the golfing legend over the weekend.  This is Woods' fifth green jacket, and his win on Sunday is already being lauded as one of the greatest sports comebacks of all time.President Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods because of his success and comeback in sports and lifeWoods earned his fifth green jacket Sunday after it seemed his career was over following several physical obstacles and person issues The Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States that recognizes 'an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors'It was established in 1945 to honor civilian service during World War II.Other sports icons who have received the award include Michael Jordan, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Yogi Berra, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the past few years, it seemed as though Woods' career was over as he faced a series of personal problems and chronic back pain. He had a spinal fusion surgery in 2017.That same year, he faced charges for driving under the influence.Woods' personal life, and career, had already been on the decline before the back surgery and DUI charge when years before his ongoing cheating was brought to light.  Woods won the Gene Serazen Cup in 2013 at the Cadillac Championship golf tournament at Trump National Dural in Florida. Trump is an avid golfer and often spends his free time on the courseWoods' last Masters win before Sunday was in 2005, 14 years agoWoods met his now-former wife Elin Nordegren in 2001, and they had two children.In 2009 the chronic cheating went public when the National Enquirer published a story outlining his relationship with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub hostess.  Woods also had a relationship with cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs. Other than his two mistresses, Woods also reportedly had unprotected sex with porn starts. Following the scandals Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors of Woods lost billions of dollars collectively, and some dropped him completely. At the time, Woods released a statement saying he was 'taking an indefinite leave from golf to work on saving his marriage,' and wanted to focus 'on being a better husband, father, and person.' Woods had a few good seasons upon returning to golf after news of the affairs simmered, but never had another big win until this weekend. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Jessica Green and Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline and David Churchill and Peter Allen In Paris For The Daily Mail  Published: 15:34 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 01:11 EDT, 16 April 2019   1kView  commentsThe French Interior Ministry said 400 firefighters were mobilised to help tackle the blaze that engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday.And while hundreds of comments flooded the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters, many questions were raised as to how the fire was dealt with.Did fire crews react quickly enough? The Paris fire chief last night paid tribute to his crews, saying they had saved the cathedral from total destruction.Commander Jean-Claude Gallet said a major accomplishment of hundreds of firefighters was stopping the flames from spreading to the north tower belfry.The ministry said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze He said two-thirds of Notre Dame's roofing 'has been ravaged' and one firefighter was injured. Fire crews will keep working overnight to cool down the structure, Mr Gallet added.However, there was criticism that the fire service had not responded quickly enough – and didn't seem to have the right equipment to tackle such a large blaze.Flames appeared to be raging inside the cathedral for a long time before water jets capable of stopping them were mobilised.Were the fire crews well-equipped enough to deal with the flames?Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a height. Last night, the French interior ministry tried to defend the response – insisting that 400 firemen had been deployed.The ministry suggested that aircraft were not used because it was feared that the weight of water falling at such a height could cause large parts of the cathedral to collapse.Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a heightIn an online statement it said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze.However, pictures appeared to show that this was the only one of its kind and residents questioned why more pressure hoses and cherry-picker cranes were not on site to be able to douse the flames from above as they took hold of the scaffolding and the roof near to the spire.As the blaze raged, the Paris authorities insisted that getting fire teams to the top of the building 'was almost impossible'.'It's much too high up, and the only access is stone and spiral staircases,' said an emergency services source. 'This means that the fire has been able to spread across the roof.'Jets of water are seen desperately trying to extinguish the flames engulfing Notre DameLocal resident Michel Dupont said those living around the cathedral were upset more equipment was not on site to spray water at the flames high up. 'A lot of us are asking questions about the authorities' response,' he said.Liz Boeder, another Parisian, said 'we need California firefighters', in reference to the water-carrying aircraft used to tackle the forest fires in the US last year. Others who watched the blaze unfold on live TV also raised questions.Kent Ardleb said: 'What a tragedy. Notre Dame cathedral is lost. Where is the damn fire brigade?'Another posted: 'How come there aren't any fire fighters or water jets to be seen on any photos!?'Dave Pasin said: 'It seems there are no firefighters to be seen, no water, nothing?'The French Interior Ministry has mobilised 400 firefighters to help tackle the inferno that has been burning for hours Why did the fire brigade not drop water on the Notre Dame Cathedral?Authorities have revealed they were unable to drop water on the landmark to tame the blaze for fear it would ruin what was left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.French news site Le Monde, explained: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.Firefighters look at the fire at the landmark Notre Dame Cathedral in central Paris as they cross a bridge over the Seine river'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.' What caused the blaze to spread so quickly?The roof structure is made entirely in timber, with each beam being made from a single oak tree in a tight lattice – which may be the key to understanding last night's disaster. In all, 5,000 oaks were used in making it.Using innovative architectural techniques to assert France's growing status as a European power, its soaring vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses and doors surmounted by a row of figures of Old Testament kings were an expression of royal grandeur.The building is longer than a football pitch at 427ft, with its largely wooden spire – which collapsed on Monday – once soaring 300ft into the Parisian sky. The sheer amount of wood and its grand scale both worked against it when the blaze took hold. A picture taken less than a month ago shows a scaffold during the restoration of Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, in Paris'It makes sense that it would be incredibly flammable,' explained Notre Dame contributor Daniel Christian on the website for the landmark.The structure's aging wooden frame has long been a topic of concern, and a $6.8million renovation project was underway to address some of the many issues at the historic building.But as the fire 'started near the spire, where the scaffolding is,' it has been suggested that the renovation work sparked the flames.Officials have not yet determined if this was the case. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.com  Published: 14:48 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 08:19 EDT, 16 April 2019   1View  commentsShots were reportedly fired in an alleged drive-by shooting at California rapper YG's Coachella after-party following his earlier performance.The Big Bank rapper performed on the Coachella stage on Sunday night where he paid tribute to his close friend LA rapper Nipsey Hussle who was murdered two weeks ago.

Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.  Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe. Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women. Cook, who born in 1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found. She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985. Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine. Prudhomme, who was born in 1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed. The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered. Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine. Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved. Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Associated Press and Dailymail.com Reporters  Published: 01:51 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:57 EDT, 15 April 2019   3View  commentsA judge has decided that the white man suspected in the burning of three African American churches in Louisiana will remain in jail as state prosecutors added new charges declaring the arsons a hate crime.Holden Matthews, 21, the son of a sheriff's deputy, entered his not guilty plea via video conference from Louisiana's St. Landry Parish jail Monday morning. The judge denied bond and set a September trial date.Matthews was arrested April 10 in connection with the arson attacks at three historically-black churches over a 10-day period in Opelousas, Louisiana.  A judge denied Holden Matthews, 21, bail after he pleaded not guilty to charges against him via video conference Monday. He is suspected in the burnings of three black churches in Louisiana, which authorities think could be a hate crime Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church, in Opelousas, Louisiana, is one of the three historic black churches Matthews is suspected of setting on fire in early AprilProtesters from Louisiana's St. Landry Parish branch of the NAACP were seen holding signs outside the courthouse during Matthews' bond hearing Monday In denying Matthews bail, state District Judge James Doherty sided with law enforcement officials who said they worried Matthews would try to flee the area or set more fires. 'We felt that he was an immediate risk to public safety,' said Louisiana Fire Marshal Butch Browning. 'In my mind, I felt another fire was imminent.'Testifying in court, Browning outlined a litany of evidence, including some new details of the investigation, that he said tied Matthews to the torching of the three black churches over 10 days.The fire marshal described cellphone records placing Matthews at the fire locations, and he said images on the phone showed all three churches burning before law enforcement arrived and showed Matthews 'claiming responsibility' for the fires.The judge denied Matthews' bond and set a September trial date. In addition to his original charges of arson of a religious building, prosecutors added charges of violating Louisiana's hate crime law Monday Louisiana State Fire Marshal Butch Browning appeared in court Monday, telling the judge that he felt that Matthews would either flee or start another fire if he received a bondMatthews, who had no previous criminal record, was arrested Wednesday on three charges of arson of a religious building. Prosecutors filed documents Monday adding three more charges, accusing Matthews of violating Louisiana's hate crime law, confirming that they believe the fires were racially motivated, a link authorities had previously stopped short of making.Browning said federal officials also are considering filing additional federal hate crime and arson charges against Matthews.Matthews, shackled and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, never spoke to the court during the hearing, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter the not guilty plea for him. His parents watched their son's appearance on video conference from the courtroom, his dad repeatedly wringing his hands and, at one point, leaving the room in tears.The fires, all started with gasoline, occurred in and around Opelousas, about 60 miles west of Louisiana's capital city of Baton Rouge.Authorities said Matthews had ties to 'black metal' - an extreme subgenre of heavy metal that has an association with church burnings in other parts of the worldMatthews is described on his Facebook page as the lead singer for a heavy metal band called Vodka Vultures and showed an interest in 'black metal' music, some of which has been linked to fires at Christian churches in Norway in the 1990sMount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas was the last of the three churches to be burned down on April 4Firefighters and fire investigators respond to a fire at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4Emergency crews are seen outside the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, which was also burned down Matthews' arrest came a little more than two weeks after the first blaze at the St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26 in Port Barre, a town just outside of Opelousas. Days later, the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas were burned. Each was more than 100 years old.The churches were empty at the time, and no one was injured. But at one location, two occupants of a nearby home had to evacuate when the siding on the home started to catch fire from the church.The fires set the community on edge. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the church burnings were a reminder 'of a very dark past of intimidation and fear.'Matthews' attorney Quincy Cawthorne questioned some of the evidence cited by Browning and said Matthews didn't have the financial means to be a flight risk. He also objected to suggestions that the house near one of the churches was intentionally set on fire, putting the residents' lives in danger.A pretrial hearing in the case was set for July 17, with jury selection scheduled to begin September 10.Prosecutors, through Browning's testimony, gave more insight into the evidence that law enforcement used to build their case against Matthews.Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau investigators work the crime scene of the burnt ruins of the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church the week after the fire was setCharred remains of pews were among the rubble left after one of the churches burned downThe exterior of one of the churches Matthews is accused of having set on fire in LouisianaThe fire marshal said a receipt shows Matthews bought a gas can and a package of oil rags similar to those found at the site of the fires. A lighter and the package of oil rags, missing some of its contents, were found in Matthews' truck, Browning said. He said Matthews documented the fire on his cellphone, while video surveillance in the area around the churches showed a truck similar to the one Matthews drives. Matthews had copies of news reports about the fires on his phone as well, Browning said.'He actually superimposed himself on those news reports, claiming responsibility for these fires,' Browning said.In addition, Browning said video on Matthews' phone showed a conversation with a friend before the fires in which he talked about burning churches and using gasoline to do it. The fire marshal said Matthews posted on Facebook about and showed interest in a movie called 'Lords of Chaos,' which Browning said is a recent Norwegian film that involved church burnings.Matthews seen posing with a guitar in front of a spray-painted 'black metal' sign Matthew was known to post pictures of alters to Norse gods on his Facebook pageThe alters featured bits and pieces of bones as well as things meant to symbolize the godsMatthews also posted this image of a gun and a knife which he claimed to carry aroundMatthews had shown interest in 'black metal,' an extreme subgenre of heavy metal, Browning said. The music has been linked, in some instances, to fires at Christian churches in Norway in the 1990s.  'The evidence we have was unequivocal,' Browning said. Later he added: 'He has clearly demonstrated the characteristics of a pathological fire setter.'Matthews' Facebook page describes him as the lead singer for a heavy metal band called Vodka Vultures.A Facebook page that appeared to belong to Matthews showed him with the words 'black metal' spray painted on a wall behind him. He also posted a comment on a movie's portrayal of black metal musician Varg Vikernes, a far-right figure convicted of manslaughter and arson at three churches in Norway.Black metal lyrics often espouse satanism and paganism, and a few bands feature neo-Nazi beliefs.The three churches destroyed by the fires have mostly black Baptist congregations, raising authorities' suspicion that the fires may be racially motivated hate crimes.The NAACP believed the fires were racially motivated given that they took place in historically black areas and called for the acts to be labeled as 'domestic terrorism'.'We must not turn a blind eye to any incident where people are targeted because of the color of their skin or their faith,' the group said in a statement April 8.'The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country. But this is nothing new.' Just days prior to his arrest in connection with the church fires, Matthews was said to have turned to Facebook to express his anger about Baptists 'brainwashing' people, CNN reported.   Matthews, apparently using the screen name 'Noctis Matthews' responded to a Facebook post about 'afrikan spirituality,' by writing that he could not 'stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine.'He also went on to write that he wished 'more blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa.' Matthews was also said to have posted images of weapons and alters made to Norse gods on his personal Facebook, which included bits and pieces of animal bones, a fake human skull and other odds and ends. Matthews' father, Deputy Roy Matthews, was said to have been in the courtroom when his son pleaded not guilty and was seen wringing his hands and leaving the room in tears, CBS News reported. Roy Matthews, who was not aware of his son's actions, was said to have 'broke down' when he was called into the sheriff's office and told about the allegations against his son. He then helped facilitate his son's arrest.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Sarah Sotoodeh For Dailymail.com  Published: 15:13 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 16:13 EDT, 15 April 2019   25View  commentsLast week she was spotted holding hands with beau Jamie Foxx in a rare display of affection while stepping out in Los Angeles with his daughter Corinne. And on Monday, Katie Holmes was seen heading out solo in New York City.The actress, 40, cut a casual figure in sweats while on the way to the gym with a green smoothie in hand.Low key: Katie Holmes was seen heading out solo in New York City on Monday morningKatie rocked a pale pink colored sweater with navy sweat bottoms, adding red and white Adidas sneakers.The gorgeous actress wore her brunette tresses pulled back into a low bun, opting to go makeup free to showcase her natural beauty. Katie added vintage-inspired sunglasses with a coordinating large black handbag she slung over one shoulder.The former Dawson's Creek star toted a large green smoothie in one hand as she made her way to a gym in the Big Apple.Staying warm: The actress, 40, cut a casual figure in sweats while on the way to the gym with a green smoothie in handCasual: Katie rocked a pale pink colored sweater with navy sweat bottoms, adding red and white Adidas sneakersKatie and Jamie, 51, have been quietly dating for about six years.Their most recent sighting was last week.

The couple flew out on January 23 and stayed at The Lagoons, a gated community in Montego Bay where a two-bedroom villa can cost up to $15,000 a week.Bickelmann met Lee through exclusive dating app The League in fall 2018 and the couple went on two trips together to South Carolina in December and Jamaica in January 2019On the Jamaica trip, Lee 'violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand,' according to court documents seen by DailyMail.com. Lee is pictured second from the left at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) conference in 2016As before, Lee paid for everything and, as before, things quickly descended into acrimony.On January 25, two days after their arrival, Bicklemann claims, that Lee committed the first of two assaults against her after they got into an argument in a taxicab.Bickelmann, who works as a buyer for fashion store Milly, is suing for damages to recover from 'personal injuries, emotional distress, assault and battery'According to her lawsuit, 'Lee grabbed [her] face with his hand, shoved her backwards away from him into the seat of the taxi cab and called [her] 'a f***ing b****.'Shocked, Bickelmann called a male friend who advised her that Lee's behavior was 'abnormal and that she should leave Jamaica as soon as she could for her own safety.'She told Lee that she wanted to return to New York and he agreed to change her departure flight from January 27 to 26 while he stayed on.Her court filing states that Lee had planned a yacht outing at 1pm on the day of her departure and therefore told her to leave the villa and head to the airport at 12.30pm.When she said she did not want to make the short trip - some fifteen minutes drive - so early as her flight was not until 3.30pm the couple got into an argument over the best way to lock up the villa.Lee didn't want to be late but nor did he want to leave the keys with Bickelmann.According to Bickelmann the verbal argument turned violent when she attempted to leave the patio where they had been arguing and go back inside.She claimed, 'In the midst of removing herself from this argument with [Lee] who was continuously yelling at her in a degrading manner and cursing at her, [Lee] violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand.'The hit was so unexpected and violent, she claims, she lost her balance and fell onto a nearby patio chair.Bickelmann says in the lawsuit that Lee knew she had previously been in an abusive relationship and suffered from TMJ which was made worse by his alleged abuseAfter regaining her balance, her complaint continued, 'she ran to another chair…now in fear of being hit a second time… she began to cry and was in disbelief he struck her.'Bickelmann claimed her face 'began to swell and become very red,' and that she repeatedly stated, 'Ram you just hit me!'Her screams and their shouting were loud enough for a concerned neighbor to call The Lagoons Security who witnessed Lee pull the weeping Bickelmann back into the villa and shut the sliding glass doors.The alleged assault was made all the worse, Bickelmann has claimed, by the fact that Lee knew her to be a victim of domestic violence and that she suffered from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder causing her severe pain in her jaw.She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the alleged assault.DailyMail.com has requested comment from both Lee and Bicklemann's attorney, but have not heard back. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Alisha Buaya For Mailonline  Published: 15:27 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 04:40 EDT, 16 April 2019  View  commentsShe is not shy about flaunting her curvy physique in saucy outfits. But on Monday, Chloe Ferry covered up after landing back in Newcastle after a weekend away in Belfast with boyfriend Sam Gowland.The 23-year-old reality star looked cosy in an over-sized white jumper, matched with grey tights and white sneakers walking outside the airport.Looking cosy: Chloe Ferry covered up in an over-sized white jumper after landing back in Newcastle after a weekend away in Belfast with boyfriend Sam GowlandShe toted a couple of shopping bags and her pink suitcase with 'Chloe' emblazoned across the front.Alongside the Geordie Shore stunner was her beau Sam who also looked warm in his puffer jacket and black ensemble matched with trainers.He also brought along with him his suitcase, personalised with his initials SG. As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrière. Back home: The 23-year-old looked cosy alongside her beau Sam who also looked warm in his puffer jacket and black ensemble matched with trainers as they walked through the car parkJust peachy: As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrièreJust peachy: As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrièreTheir weekend away comes after Chloe came under fire from body confidence advocate Jameela Jamil for promoting weight loss products, a move that has resulted in her receiving death threats.The reality TV star was slammed for sharing a post about V24 'gummies' -

This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Sweden sequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe. The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland. The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmström, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths. Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe. The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea (pictured) is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles. A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia. These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and the level of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

She was arrested in September 2017 after returning to the US without her children to change child support arrangements.Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov previously rejected a plea from Kansas Republican Rep. Ron Estes that the younger children -  six-year-old Sophia and four-year-old Isabella - be reunited with their father. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a briefing that the children are living with relatives in Kaliningrad, The Wichita Eagle reported. A US judge granted Bogdana's American ex-husband, Brian Mobley (pictured left and right) full custody of the children (daughter Sophia seen left) in December 2014Mobley said he has not seen Sophia (right) from the time she was one, and he has never met his daughter Isabella (left)Osipova's oldest child, Ian, is 16, and her first husband isn't seeking custody of him.Antonov told Estes that Osipova has been a victim of 'discrimination and psychological pressure' in the US criminal case.'We've attempted to work with Russian authorities to find a diplomatic solution to this situation on behalf of a constituent, but clearly Russia is not interested in adhering to court rulings or acting in good faith,' Estes said Friday in a tweet. 'I once again call on Russia to reunite this father with his children and will work with the State Department in solving this case.'Weeks before Osipova left for Russia, Mobley filed for divorce and was granted joint custody. The Russian court system granted the couple a divorce in July 2014. That December, a Kansas judge also granted the couple a divorce and ordered her to return the two youngest children. The Kansas judge awarded sole custody to her ex-husband because Osipova had left the US without court approval or Mobley's knowledge.A Russian court has found that the children should remain in Russia with Osipova According to the US criminal complaint, Mobley hasn't been able to see his children. His ex-wife in January 2015 showed up to a meeting in Poland without the children. She allowed him to talk to the children on the phone and on Skype until November 2016, when she said he needed to send money to communicate with them, the complaint said.Zakharova said the Russian court sees the situation differently.'Her claim to her ex-husband for alimony, which was supported by a Russian court, was qualified there as extortion,' Zakharova said in the ministry's translation of a briefing.Mobley's new wife, Melissa, wrote on Facebook in 2017: 'He was in an abusive marriage and when he tried to divorce her she left to use the kids as leverage over him. She is all kinds of evil.' Melissa and Brian Mobley got married in 2015 and are currently raising four daughters together.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
Batting all-rounder Vijay Shankar on Monday experienced a "dream come true" moment after being named in India's World Cup squad and said he is learning the art of handling pressure in a mega event from IPL teammates like Bhuvneshwar Kumar."I am extremely elated to be in the Indian WC team. This is like a dream come true. We have a few World Cup winning team members here at SunRisers Hyderabad and I have spoken to them to understand what it feels like to play in a WC and then go on to win it. I have learnt a lot from them on the ways to manage pressure at such a large scale event," said Shankar referring to his IPL teammate Bhuvneshwar.Shankar is expected to be used as a floater in the batting order, especially at number 4. With his "three-dimensional qualities", the Tamil Nadu player took the slot which was speculated to go to Ambati Rayudu before his dip in form in the home series against Australia last month.Bhuvneshwar, who will be playing his second World Cup, too was elated."I am extremely happy to be selected for the World Cup, the conducive English conditions will suit my strength and I am looking to make the most of it. Playing for SRH in IPL has given me the right match practice just before the mega tournament like World Cup," he said.SRH team mentor and former India batsman VVS Laxman said Indian selectors have picked a strong squad."The Indian team is a very balanced side and is one of the strong contenders for the title. I have closely monitored Bhuvi and Vijay in the nets while they were on SRH duties.They look in great shape and are raring to perform on a stage like World Cup. I can see these players contributing in team's success in a major way," said Laxman.AdvertisementAdvertisementSportsMore

Hardik Pandya produced a sensational late cameo of 37 not out off just 16 balls as he guided Mumbai Indians to a five-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore in an IPL match in Mumbai on Monday. Chasing 172 for a win, the match was in a balance when he came out in the 16th over but Hardik, who was named in India's World Cup squad on Monday, turned the game on its head, smashing five boundaries and two sixes during his unconquered 16-ball innings on a turning track at the Wankhede Stadium.              Mumbai needed 22 runs from the last two overs but Hardik took just six balls to hit the required runs, smashing left-arm spinner Pawan Negi for two boundaries and as many sixes to end the run chase. He finished the game with a single off the last ball of the 19th over as Mumbai reached 172 for 5 in 19 overs.           This was Mumbai's fifth win in eight games and they are now at third spot with 10 points, while RCB suffered their seventh defeat in eight matches and the Virat Kohli-led team are languishing at the bottom of the table.              Earlier, veteran Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga took four wickets for 31 runs as Mumbai restricted RCB to 171 for 7. Mumbai were off to a flying start in their run chase with openers Rohit Sharma (28) and Quinton de Kock (40) finding the boundaries with ease.          De Kock took 16 runs from the third over bowled by Umesh Yadav, smashing two boundaries and a six while captain Rohit was elegant as ever, hitting a four and a six off Mohammed Siraj the next over.               Mumbai were wallopping at 67 for no loss at the end of first powerplay overs but suddenly off-spinner Moeen Ali (2/28) brought RCB back into the match with a two-wicket burst in a single over.           The Englishman removed the two set openers Rohit and de Kock in the space of four deliveries in the eighth over. Rohit was done in a by a delivery which turned viciously from the offside while de Kock was plumbed in front as he was beaten by a delivery which skidded instead of turning and Mumbai were 71 for 2 in 7.4 overs.   Ishan Kishan (21) came out and nonchalantly smashed two sixes off Negi before he fell to Yuzvendra Chahal (2/27), stumped by Parthiv Patel.           The Mumbai run chase started stuttering and with the pitch turning, Suryakumar Yadav (29) and Krunal Pandya (11) was finding it difficult to get the boundaries. Play was held up for a few minutes in the 13th over with Chahal seemingly having some problem on his little finger but he returned to bowl his fourth over and had the wicket of Suryakumar who holed out to Navdeep Saini near the boundary.    Hardik was nearly out in the 17th over but it was his elder brother Krunal who was out in the next over off the bowling of Mohammed Siraj. It was then left to Hardik to take Mumbai to victory in a dramatic fashion. Earlier, AB de Villiers and Moeen Ali hit impressive half centuries to guide Royal Challengers Bangalore to a respectable 171 for 7 after being put into bat.       After RCB lost skipper Virat Kohli (8 off 9 balls) and Parthiv Patel (28 off 20 balls) inside seven overs, de Villiers (75 in 51 balls) along with Ali (50 runs in 32 balls) resurrected the innings with a 95-run stand for the third wicket.               The South African star stamped his authority, hammering six fours and four sixes, as he completed his half-century in 41 balls. Ali was a little bit more aggressive than De Villiers as he hit five sixes and a lone boundary as the two took the MI attack to cleaners.          Ali initially played second fiddle but later upped the ante. He was particularly severe on Australian pacer Jason Behrendorff (1/49), whom he hit for two sixes and a four in the 16th over, which fetched 17 runs for RCB. De Villiers, who took time to settle, then showed his class, as he hit round the park.However, veteran Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga (4/31) pegged the visiting side back by removing Ali and Marcus Stonis (0) in the 18th over and taking two wickets in the final over. De Villiers was run out in the final over off a brilliant throw from long-on.AdvertisementAdvertisementSportsMoreWWE legend Mickie James has revealed she wants to become the “Monday Night Milf” if she keeps her place on Raw.She will have to make it through the first-ever Superstar Shake-up, a series of trades within the Raw and Smackdown brands. It kicks off tonight, and potentially every wrestler on the WWE’s roster could be involved. Mickie, 39, tweeted: “So if I stay on WWE Monday Night Raw…I mean..can we get Monday Night Milf over or naw?!“Maybe a t-shirt?!

'We have shovels, picks, rods and we will not get tired because there are still more treasures to find.'The group gathered on Saturday at 8am local time at the Sonora prosecutor's' office before embarking on the search.María Teresa Valadez (center) leads the team of searchers that have been trying to locate the bodies of their missing friends and family members sine 2017On Sunday, the government of the north-central state of Guanajuato said that state or local police will accompany Red Cross ambulances 'on the high risk or high-impact calls.' That would presumably be calls related to gunshot victims.A day prior, a man wounded by gunfire was abducted by gunmen from a Red Cross ambulance in the city of Salamanca, which has been plagued by violence between fuel theft gangs due to its gasoline refinery.The Guanajuato state chapter of the first-aid group shuttered operations in the city of 270,000 but later resumed ambulance service.In a statement, the Mexican Red Cross said it 'is an impartial and neutral institution before all conflicts and its purpose is to relieve human suffering,' adding the '#We are not part of the conflict' hashtag.Violence in Mexico has worsened in the last year, with homicides running at their highest rate on record and surpassing the previous peak set in 2011.Earlier this month, a woman with gunshot wounds was executed inside an ambulance in Mexico's Pacific state of Guerrero, while paramedics were reportedly beaten up.The archdiocese of the central state of Puebla said in a recent statement that Rev. Ambrosío Arellano Espinoza, a 78-year-old priest, was apparently tortured during a robbery attempt. It said he had been found with severe burns on his hands and feet, but was at a hospital in stable but serious condition.Clandestine burial sites have often been used by drug cartels in Mexico to hide the bodies of executed rivals or kidnap victims.While hundreds of such sites date back to the height of the drug war from 2010 to 2016, some are more recent.Searchers in Mexico generally count the dead by the number of skulls, but not all heads are always present at the time of burial, suggesting death tolls could be even higher.Volunteer searchers often act on tips about where burial grounds are located and then walk through fields plunging rods into the earth to detect the telltale odor of decomposing bodies. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Associated Press and Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 12:12 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 16:53 EDT, 15 April 2019   15View  commentsRussia is demanding that the US release a Russian citizen who was convicted of kidnapping for moving her children from Kansas to her country of origin amid  divorce proceedings.Bogdana Osipova, who is referred to by her married name of Mobley in court documents, was convicted in Kansas last month of one count of international parental kidnapping and two counts of attempting to extort money. Ospivoa, 38, faces up to 20 years in prison on each extortion count and up to three years on the kidnapping count at her May 20 sentencing hearing.Bogdana Osipova (pictured left and right in her mugshot), 38, was convicted last month of one count of international parental kidnapping and two counts of attempting to extort moneyUS prosecutors said Osipova kidnapped her children (pictured with their mother) by moving them from Kansas to her native Russia The Russian Embassy in the US released a statement demanding that Osipova be releasedThe Russian Embassy said in a tweet Friday that US authorities should 'stop their lawless behavior and release the Russian citizen Bogdana Osipova, thus returning the mother to her children.' A Russian court has found that the children should remain in Russia.US prosecutors said Osipova, who emigrated to the US in 2003 and has dual citizenship, left Wichita, Kansas, in April 2014 with one child from her first marriage and another child from a second marriage to Brian Mobley, an Air Force recruiter. She gave birth to a third child soon after returning to Russia. She was arrested in September 2017 after returning to the US without her children to change child support arrangements.Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov previously rejected a plea from Kansas Republican Rep. Ron Estes that the younger children -  six-year-old Sophia and four-year-old Isabella - be reunited with their father. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a briefing that the children are living with relatives in Kaliningrad, The Wichita Eagle reported. A US judge granted Bogdana's American ex-husband, Brian Mobley (pictured left and right) full custody of the children (daughter Sophia seen left) in December 2014Mobley said he has not seen Sophia (right) from the time she was one, and he has never met his daughter Isabella (left)Osipova's oldest child, Ian, is 16, and her first husband isn't seeking custody of him.Antonov told Estes that Osipova has been a victim of 'discrimination and psychological pressure' in the US criminal case.'We've attempted to work with Russian authorities to find a diplomatic solution to this situation on behalf of a constituent, but clearly Russia is not interested in adhering to court rulings or acting in good faith,' Estes said Friday in a tweet. 'I once again call on Russia to reunite this father with his children and will work with the State Department in solving this case.'Weeks before Osipova left for Russia, Mobley filed for divorce and was granted joint custody. The Russian court system granted the couple a divorce in July 2014. That December, a Kansas judge also granted the couple a divorce and ordered her to return the two youngest children. The Kansas judge awarded sole custody to her ex-husband because Osipova had left the US without court approval or Mobley's knowledge.A Russian court has found that the children should remain in Russia with Osipova According to the US criminal complaint, Mobley hasn't been able to see his children. His ex-wife in January 2015 showed up to a meeting in Poland without the children. She allowed him to talk to the children on the phone and on Skype until November 2016, when she said he needed to send money to communicate with them, the complaint said.Zakharova said the Russian court sees the situation differently.'Her claim to her ex-husband for alimony, which was supported by a Russian court, was qualified there as extortion,' Zakharova said in the ministry's translation of a briefing.Mobley's new wife, Melissa, wrote on Facebook in 2017: 'He was in an abusive marriage and when he tried to divorce her she left to use the kids as leverage over him. She is all kinds of evil.' Melissa and Brian Mobley got married in 2015 and are currently raising four daughters together.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 16:09 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 17:19 EDT, 15 April 2019   23View  commentsStudents and alums from a small evangelical college in Indiana have launched a campaign to have Vice President Mike Pence’s invitation to give this year's commencement speech rescinded. More than 3,700 people have signed a petition on change.org that calls for the VP to be disinvited from the ceremony at Taylor University in May. 'Inviting Vice President Pence to Taylor University and giving him a coveted platform for his political views makes our alumni, faculty, staff and current students complicit in the Trump-Pence Administration's policies, which we believe are not consistent with the Christian ethic of love we hold dear,' the petition reads. The announcement that Pence would be the school's speaker was made last week. Students and alums from Taylor University in Indiana are outraged that Vice President Mike Pence has been invited to give this year's commencement speechMore than 3,700 people have signed a petition on change.org (pictured) that calls for the invitation for the vice president to be speak at the ceremony in May be rescindedIn a press release, the school's president, Dr. Paul Lowell Haines, said: 'Taylor University is pleased and honored to welcome to our campus and its 2019 Commencement exercises, Vice President Mike Pence.''Mr. Pence has been a good friend to the University over many years, and is a Christian brother whose life and values have exemplified what we strive to instill in our graduates. 'We welcome the Vice President and his wife, Karen Pence, to this 173-year-old premier institution of Christian higher education, and thank them for their love and service for our nation, our state, and our institution,' Haines added.  A press release posted by the school (pictured) said Pence 'has been a good friend to the University over many years'One Taylor graduate told Fox News that the school 'should be ashamed ... I am physically shaking ... I feel personally attacked'But Taylor officials said they are standing by their decision. Pence was also recently criticized by Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, who pointed out that the vice president's policies 'discriminate' against gay and lesbian Americans.Buttigieg, who went from virtual unknown to budding political phenomenon in just weeks, has mentioned Pence - the former governor of his home state of Indiana - multiple times in his speeches.In a recent address to an LGBTQ organization the rising Democratic star said his same sex marriage had brought him 'closer to God'.'I don't have a problem with religion, I'm religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people,' Buttigieg, who if elected would be America's first gay president, told NBC's The Ellen Show.'I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this up, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are.'Buttigieg, 37, has been mayor of South Bend, Indiana for seven years, while Pence was governor until joining Donald Trump as number two on the ticket in 2016.Pence and Buttigieg worked together on common-ground issues such as infrastructure but clashed over a 2015 religious freedom bill signed by Pence that Mayor Pete and others warned allowed people to discriminate on religious grounds.Pence pushed back against Buttigieg's recent remarks, telling CNN that 'he said some things that are critical of my Christian faith, and about me personally, and he knows better'.Speaking at the Victory Fund last week, Buttigieg highlighted his own Christian devotion and how it helps guide him.Pence was also recently criticized by Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, who pointed out that the vice president's policies 'discriminate' against gay and lesbian Americans And Buttigieg, who married his husband in a church service last year, challenged Pence over opposing same-sex marriage.'My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man - and yes Mr Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,' he said.'I can tell you that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,' he added.'And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me; your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.'The debate has cast the campaign spotlight on faith, as Democrats challenge the stranglehold that fundamentalist conservatives have on what it means to be Christian, especially in the Trump era.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Chris Spargo For Dailymail.com   Published: 16:09 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:13 EDT, 15 April 2019   28View  commentsThe Jupiter Police Department and Palm Beach County State Attorney's office are being sued by a man who visited Orchids of Asia Day Spa while the facility was under surveillance by authorities. A complaint filed in federal court on Monday by attorneys Edward Mullins of  Reed Smith and Joe Tacopania of The Law Offices of Tacopina & Seigel on behalf of a John Doe, accuses authorities of violating Doe's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, and constitutional right to privacy.Doe states that he was visiting the spa on January 19 for a massage that did not include any manual or oral sex act from a spa employee.The filing, which was submitted in the United states District Court for the Southern District of Florida, goes on to state that Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy as he undressed inside the spa and then received a massage while in the nude.He is now seeking monetary, punitive and exemplary damages while demanding that no copy of any of the tapes showing men inside the spa be released to the press or public.Doe also wants those tapes, and any copies, destroyed for good. Patriot: A John Doe has filed a lawsuit against the Town of Jupiter Police, Detective Andrew Sharp and David Aronberg, the Palm Beach County State's Attorney for the sex spa sting that resulted in Robert Kraft (above) being charged with two misdemeanors High voltage: Doe claims that he was filmed both undressing and then nude by police who put hidden cameras in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa (above) on January 19The court filing argues that should those tapes be released, innocent victims like Doe might be exposed due to interest in one of the case's high-profile defendants, billionaire New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.'On or around January 19, 2019, Mr. Doe entered the Spa and received a massage, while undressed, in a private massage room,' reads the filing.It goes on to state that a licensed therapist provided Doe with this massage. 'On information and belief, the Jupiter Police recorded Mr. Doe while undressed and receiving a massage. Mr. Doe did not engage in any sexual or illegal activity at any time while receiving his massage at the Spa,' states the complaint.'Upon information and belief, the Jupiter Police shared these recordings with other individuals and organizations pursuing or acting in parallel with the Investigation, including officers employed by the Jupiter Police, Aronberg and other members of the Palm Beach County State’s Attorney Office, and, on information and belief, the Martin County Sheriff and the Martin County DA, who were running a related investigation.'The filing then references the interest in the case because of Kraft and how that interest, combined with the realization that Doe had been filmed without his knowledge, has caused the man distress.  'The risk of public access demands is particularly acute in the present case, as certain of the defendants charged with misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution include high profile individuals, and the media has already actively sought to obtain the videos collected by the Jupiter Police at the Spa,' writes Tacopania.'There is, therefore, a grave risk that the video will be made public absent immediate court action.' Die has 'suffered invasion ... embarrassment, loss of business opportunities, and substantial expenses—including legal fees and court costs' reads the complaint.Damages are not the only remedy the man is seeking either, as he asks that officials be ordered ' to permanently and completely destroy, any and all video, audio, photographic, or other recordings, or any images or other records derived from or based on recordings, made inside the Spa.'TMZ was the first to report on this new lawsuit. Detective Andrew Sharp is also named in the lawsuit as a defendant for his actions on the case.'Without probable cause and without a warrant, Sharp requested that an inspector from the Florida Department of Health perform a warrantless search of the Spa. That investigator, Karen Herzog, interviewed each of the employees present in the Spa, and took pictures of their identifications and a fridge and a freezer,' reads the complaint. 'Herzog also completed a report indicating that the Spa was not used as a place of domicile.'A lawyer for Kraft did not hold back on the same subject earlier this month, going after the Martin Circuity Sheriff's Office after it was revealed no human trafficking charges would be filed in the spa bust.'Sheriff Will Snyder admitted that there was no human trafficking,' said attorney William Burck.'He lied about it. His officers lied about it. I don’t really know what to say. I’ve never seen anything quite like that before.'Authorities had initially obtained warrants to install hidden cameras after a health inspector noted evidence that suggested women were living at the spa during a visit to one of the establishments.Sheriff Snyder then had to back off that claim, despite firmly stating that Kraft and the other men accused of soliciting were engaging ins ex acts with trafficked women.'They are supposed to be upholding the law. They are supposed to be officers of justice, but instead he's concocting false allegations against people in order to further headlines rather than justice,' said Burck.'Sheriff Snyder said "the monsters are the men." Sheriff Snyder is the liar.' Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupGetty ImageFans often try to sell some wild artist memorabilia but perhaps no wilder item has appeared for sale in recent memory than Childish Gambino’s discarded blunt from Coachella. During his spectacular Friday night set, Gambino — aka Donald Glover — was seen sharing a blunt with a fan in the crowd before returning to stage duties and entertaining the assembled crowd with a bit more of his “Summertime Magic.” Before the weekend was up, the half-smoked butt of the blunt had its own listing on Ebay, with the poster pushing for a whopping $1000 price tag. Fortunately, @hasitleaked caught a screenshot before the listing was removed, which you can see below.Someone is selling Donald Glover’s blunt from Coachella on eBay. pic.twitter.com/5ZLEXEL3e4— Has it Leaked? (@hasitleaked) April 15, 2019Naturally, there would have been absolutely no way to prove the authenticity of the item in question or approve the sale, but you have to admire the sheer temerity of whoever listed it. First of all, selling drugs online is a federal offense, so there’s that. But the poster at least made sure to do their research, describing the item in detail: “The blunt that Childish Gambino passed to a fan wearing a green shirt!” reads the description section. Since the whole performance streamed live on Coachella’s Youtube, it’s pretty unlikely that whomever that fan was is really the poster or that the posted blunt in question is the same blunt from the performance, but hey, there’s a sucker born every minute. Fortunately for all the suckers out there, Ebay took down the posting before anyone could get scammed.Of course, some lucky fans did walk away with some pretty nifty souvenirs. Gambino AirDropped a photo of some Adidas sneakers to random fans which allowed them to exchange a voucher for the super exclusive real things. Meanwhile, for those of us unlucky enough to be stuck at home during Coachella, there was still Guava Island, his musical short film with Rihanna, which was free to stream for the first 18 hours after its initial release.Getty ImageFor the past few weeks, it’s been no secret that TDE rapper Schoolboy Q has had new music on the way. The rollout began with the release of his chaotic single “Numb Numb Juice,” then followed-up with the Travis Scott-featuring scorcher “Chopstix.” Through it all, fans still had no clue what kind of project Schoolboy would be dropping or when he’d be dropping it. That all changed today when the Los Angeles rabble rouser posted a sinister trailer to his upcoming album, announcing its title and rapidly-approaching release date.

But a post-mortum revealed her injuries were much more severe than that, and consistant with a trauma The Channel 4 programme, which airs tonight, follows the investigation into the murder of Butiene, 48, who was killed at her home in Wisbech in April 2017.Cambridgeshire's major crime unit launched an investigation into her death after a pathologist raised concerns around the circumstances.Police were called at 8.30pm by three men in a flat in Orange Grove, Wisbech, who said that Butiene, 48, had been drinking, fallen over and died. But suspicions were raised by the ambulance service who said that it appeared Butiene had died a while before the phone call was made. CCTV and witness evidence showed that Bauzys had visited a corner shop half an hour before he placed the call to the emergency services but that he revealed his girlfriend was already deadWhen police arrived at the flat, it appeared she had been dead for a longer period of time, with injuries to her face and chest consistent with somebody kneeing or standing on it. The three men who were in the flat stumbled around, seemingly finding it hard to answer police questions, with Bauzys wondering in and out of the room where the body of his girlfriend of four years was. When DS Graham McMillan, who has dealt with over 200 murders during his career, is sent photos of the dead woman, they immediately raise suspicions. He says: ‘You do get a hunch just through experience, something isn’t right... I’ve looked at the photos that were taken of the lady in situ and what concerns me, is some of the bruising around the chest and the neck area.’  Dzilva Butiene, 48, had been with her boyfriend for four years. He was later found guilty of her murder And later, the post mortem showed that the woman had died as a result of a trauma to the abdomen that caused her liver to lacerate in two places. Police said the injury was consistent 'with an assault, fall from a first floor building or high speed collision where a victim wasn't wearing a seatbelt'. A man hunt was launched for Butiene's boyfriend of four years, who had turned off his mobile phone and appeared to be in hiding. He was found sleeping in a tent in the woods outside of Wisbech. Enquiries by the unit revealed Bauzys had visited a nearby shop about 30 minutes before the ambulance was called. Police discovered Bauzys sleeping in a tent in the woods outside Wisbech, where he was arrested for his girlfriend's murder  Butiene had moved from Lithuiana to be with her boyfriend, but was about to return to the country for treatment for her alcoholism CCTV showed Bauzys entering a corner shop, and speaking to a shop assistant.When the shop assistant was called in by police, he told how the Lithuanian was 'absolutely white, transparent.' He went on that while he was paying: 'He said to me, he thinks his wife, something might have happened because she doesn't move.He revealed that Bauzys had told him: '"She might be dead". So I asked him so what, doesn't she breathe?'  Police investigating the crime were puzzled by the post-mortem, which revealed a traumatic injury to Butiene's stomach which was inconsistent with her boyfriend's version of events 'And then he said, "I don't know I checked her pulse".

Bauzys consistently lied claiming Mrs Butiene had caused her injuries herself from falling over.'The expert medical evidence stated that these type of injuries would be seen either from a forceful assault, a fall from a first floor building or a high speed road collision where the victim wasn't wearing a seatbelt.'We established that Mrs Butiene had not left the flat and that Bauzys had been the only person in her company at the time she would have received the fatal injury.'In this case officers had not received any previous reports of domestic abuse. We would urge anyone who finds themselves in an abusive relationship, please find the courage to tell someone. You don't have to come direct to police but it's not acceptable to live with abuse.'In a statement Mrs Butiene's family said: 'Dzilva's death has left utter devastation to all her friends and family here in Lithuania, including her two sons. We have all been affected by her death and remain to take each day at a time.'Bauzys was sentenced to life in prison in 2017, and a minimum of 17-and-a-half years. Source: Cambrideshire police   Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
