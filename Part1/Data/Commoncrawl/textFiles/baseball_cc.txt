Robinson is as revered an athlete as you will find in any sport and has become a symbol for how a single person can change a powerful institution for the better. While Robinson himself has survived the magnifying glass of history the way few individuals can, his legacy is still susceptible to reexamination—specifically, it is worth examining what integration truly means.As important as Robinson’s debut was, it certainly did not signal that any racial reconciliation or equality had been achieved. Robinson was but one player in a league otherwise full of white men, and his presence did not result in an integrated Major League Baseball in 1947. Instead, integration happened in a long, slow march over the course of more than a generation, with many individuals playing their own barrier-breaking roles. It would take a dozen years after Robinson’s debut before the Boston Red Sox became the final team to sign its first black player, inking Pumpsie Green in 1959. Jackie didn’t live to see Frank Robinson become the first black manager  in 1975.AdvertisementOne of the defining features of baseball’s early steps toward integration was the standard of exceptionalism that the first black players were held to. Jackie was an immediate superstar. He won the inaugural Rookie of the Year award, and his 1949 MVP season remains one of the finest ever by a second baseman.  Had he played a full career in MLB (he entered at age 28), his cumulative numbers would place him among the all-time greats. Many other early black players followed his success: Larry Doby, the second black player in the Majors, hit over .300 in his second season, and went on to make seven All-Star teams; Roy Campanella became Robinson’s teammate in 1948 and was named an All-Star in each of his first eight full seasons; every year from 1949 to 1953, a black player was crowned the NL’s’s Rookie of the Year, including Willie Mays in 1951.But not every early black player immediately produced at an elite level, and baseball had no place for those who did not. Willard Brown, who is enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame for his contributions in the Negro leagues, was given only 67 at-bats to prove himself in 1947 with the St. Louis Browns. Failing to do so, he was unceremoniously cut. Brown went on to lead the Negro American League in home runs and won two triple crowns in the Puerto Rican Winter League, yet he was never given a second chance in MLB.  Similarly, pitcher Dan Bankhead was given a mere four-game audition with the Dodgers in 1947, and he did not pitch well.  He was then relegated to the minors, where he remained for the next two seasons despite winning 20 games each year.These players’ stories paint a more nuanced picture of the barrier itself: it was Robinson’s immense talent (and good fortune at having that talent manifest immediately) at least as much as any actual racial tolerance that led to baseball’s integration. This should be obvious and is something that Robinson himself understood. As Leo Durocher purportedly told Dodgers players who were skeptical of Robinson, “he can make us all rich.”AdvertisementOne definition of integration would be the point at which black players no longer had to be exceptional to survive; when players whose performance was close to that of an average (white) player were allowed to remain in the big leagues; when MLB finally had black journeymen. This would be a more accurate picture of a player whose presence truly represented a broader racial inclusion, rather than exceptional talent alone.The list of the first black Major League players is littered with  Hall of Famers like Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Roy Campanella, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, and Monte Irvin, and stars like Minnie Miñoso (a nine-time All-Star) and Don Newcombe (one of only two players in history to win an MVP, a Cy Young, and a Rookie of the Year award), alongside washouts who were given only the shortest chance to succeed. It was not until the mid-1950s that the first players emerge who fit into neither category.  Two players in particular, Harry Simpson and Bob Boyd, accomplished the outstanding feat of having relatively long careers (880 and 696 games, respectively) despite being black and, statistically, only average ballplayers.  These two men had different career paths, but both displayed resilience and achieved their own type of remarkable success that deserves to be celebrated alongside other pioneers like Robinson.AdvertisementIn 1949, a scout labeled a young outfielder and first baseman named Harry “Suitcase” Simpson—then with the Philadelphia Stars of the Negro National League—“the tan Ted Williams.” Lean and nimble, with a smooth swing, Simpson had up-and-down success in the Negro leagues but impressed enough to be offered a tryout for MLB teams. On April 21, 1951, the fourth game of the 1951 season, the 25-year-old Simpson made his major-league debut for the Cleveland Indians, entering as a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the eighth, making him the 16th black player in Major League Baseball. This would begin an eight-year, five-team, almost 900-game career in which Harry Simpson achieved the incredible: he built a career as a black man in Major League Baseball despite almost never being better than a serviceable starter.Far from the 67 at-bats that Willard Brown received, Simpson was given more than 1,000 at-bats with the Indians over the course of the 1951, ‘52, and ‘53 seasons.  He failed to live up to his scout-bestowed nickname, however, batting a very un-Williams-like .246.  As a result, he spent the entire 1954 season in the minors.  But Simpson persevered, thanks in part to the expanding role for black players in the Major Leagues.  Where only five of baseball’s 16 teams had fielded a black player before the 1953 season, that number had risen to 12 by the beginning of 1955.  Simpson was traded to one of those teams—the Kansas City Athletics—where he stuck as a starter.  Modern statistics rate Simpson’s performance with the Athletics as decidedly below average, and he never recorded more than one Win Above Replacement in any season with them.  But he did lead the league in triples twice, and even played in one All-Star game.  Simpson was given further opportunities with the Yankees, White Sox, and Pirates before his career petered out at the age of 34.  Near the end of his career, a newspaper article stated what would have been unimaginable for a black player only a few years prior: “No player ever received more consideration, or a longer and seemingly endless trial, than Simpson did.”       AdvertisementOn Sept 8, 1951, Bob Boyd debuted for the Chicago White Sox.  Unlike the prospect Simpson, Boyd was a 31-year old veteran of the Negro leagues, where he became known as a line-drive hitting first baseman. Boyd was the first black player to sign a contract with the Chicago White Sox, but he had bounced around the minor leagues and Minnie Miñoso had beaten him to the White Sox by four months. After accumulating a mere 18 at-bats in 1951, Boyd never saw the big leagues in 1952, despite leading both the AAA Pacific Coast League and the Puerto Rican Winter League in batting average that year. But unlike some earlier black players, he got another chance. He made the most of another shot with the White Sox in 1953 by hitting .297 in 55 games, yet was sent back to the minors, where he languished for most of 1954 and all of ‘55.  But, persevering as strongly as Simpson (or indeed, as Robinson), Boyd was signed by the Baltimore Orioles before the 1956 season, where he finally earned a regular spot on a major-league roster.  He spent five seasons with the O’s, batting over .300 in four of those years, albeit with very little power.  He remained in MLB until he was 41 years old.        Both Simpson and Boyd had long careers defined by the perseverance that we attribute to many more famous pioneers. Each carried the additional burden of being black non-stars, constantly having to justify their professional existences. Consequently, by one important set of criteria—long careers characterized by performances basically equivalent to that of an average white player—they were unmistakable pioneers of integration. They hung around the big leagues in a way that previously only white men had.To acknowledge the careers of Simpson and Boyd is not to diminish the importance of Jackie Robinson. Instead, this reframing should highlight the enormity of Robinson’s talent, and the absurd fact that black players had to be transcendent in order to receive an opportunity. More broadly, Simpson and Boyd can teach us an important lesson: If we are ever going to have responsible conversations about barrier-breaking in any paradigm, then exceptional individuals like Robinson can never be the only focus. We must not conflate the excellence of individuals who appeared first with institutional inclusion. They are not the same. Inclusion, maybe the buzziest workforce concept of our time, should instead be measured by how we treat the Harry Simpsons and Bob Boyds among us. We should ask whether everyone in our setting is allowed equal access to mediocrity. If the answer is “no,” then that institution is not inclusive, even if it has a Jackie Robinson.AdvertisementC.

He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot — estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's — projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name — 'Crush' — for a reason."Renato Núñez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vázquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velázquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vázquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vázquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBy Tim Collins For Mailonline  Published: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019   4View  commentsMore than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland.An international research team traced more than ten generations in the same grave.They said their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.More than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.  Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland. This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Sweden sequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe. The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland. The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmström, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths. Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.

A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia. These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and the level of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupIn a huge blow to Marquette's preseason top-five hopes, the Golden Eagles announced Monday that forwards Sam Hauser and Joey Hauser would be transferring out of the program.Sam Hauser told ESPN that he and his brother are planning to go to the same school.Sam Hauser will have to sit one year before playing his final season because he will not be a graduate transfer. Joey Hauser will have three years of eligibility after sitting out next season."We are thankful for all that Sam and Joey contributed to our program and University during their time at Marquette and wish them the best of luck in the future," head coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of returning players and are extremely excited about the upcoming season and future of our program."Sam, a 6-foot-8 junior, averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He shot 40.2 percent from 3-point range, marking the third season in a row he's made at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers.Joey, a 6-foot-9 freshman, averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his first season at Marquette. He also shot 42.5 percent from 3.Both players are officially in the transfer portal, sources told ESPN.With leading scorer Markus Howard back, Wojciechowski expected to have one of the best teams in the country next season. Without the Hausers, the Golden Eagles will likely fall toward the back end of the preseason top 25.Meanwhile, the Hausers will be two of the most sought-after transfers on the market.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?Photos of the Lyman Memorial baseball team

In Brendan Shanahan’s first season running the Maple Leafs, he was so concerned about the direction in which Nazem Kadri’s career was going, he suspended him from the team, essentially for insubordination.In that season of discovery and disappointment, Shanahan figured that there was enough about Kadri worth fighting for — so much so that, when he called him to his office to explain the internal suspension, he didn’t call him alone.He included his parents in the meeting, which is extraordinarily rare for anything that happens in professional sport. Players, yes. Agents, yes. But parents?Shanahan wanted the London-based Kadri family, mom and dad, to know how much he cared for the hockey player, the person, their son, the talent level. And he wanted Kadri’s parents to have a full understanding of what the expectation was to being a Maple Leaf.That was in 2015. For the most part, since that meeting, before all the roster changes and the coaching changes were made, Kadri has been a rather plentiful and effective Leafs player, one of the real success stories of Mike Babcock’s time coaching here.But there has always been some worry about him taking the wrong steps, being in the wrong place, in the wrong time. Lou Lamoriello told him that when he signed him to a long-term contract in Toronto. He told him he believed in him. He told him he was a significant building block for a team going from nowhere to somewhere.But there was always this slight concern about the former London Knights star — that decision-making wasn’t always a strength, that leadership didn’t come naturally to him, that he had to be pushed and prodded and guided to become the rather effective National Hockey League player he has become.In his early years, if the team was going to a bar after the game, Kadri would go to the bar. And if the team was going to the gym to work out, Kadri would go to the gym. There are some players who just aren’t natural leaders in any way — and Kadri seemed to head in whatever direction the wind was blowing.Most of that was before Babcock got ahold of him, helped develop a style and a role and an important place on the Maple Leafs roster. Kadri had been a target for Ron Wilson, for Dallas Eakins with the Marlies, for Peter Horachek, who came after Randy Carlyle. The talent was there; the natural maturity wasn’t.When left to play on his own instincts, his talent, his bravery, his ability to score 30 goals shone. But there was always that concern: When was he going to do the wrong thing? He did it in last year’s first-round series against the Bruins when he was suspended for three games for boarding Boston’s Tommy Wingels. The Leafs were fortunate that Lamoriello had brought in the veteran Tomas Plekanec, who filled Kadri’s spot rather neatly at a time when it seemed impossible.This year, with Lamoriello gone, with Kyle Dubas in charge of the roster, the Leafs brought in Nic Petan at the trade deadline, but not to fill the kind of role Kadri will now be abandoning. He is the wrong size and the wrong fit to play against the Boston Bruins.On Monday, the expectation is that Kadri, 28, will be suspended for his undisciplined and unnecessary cross-check to the neck of Jake DeBrusk and it’s entirely possible he won’t play another game in the first round against the Bruins.That judgment seems harsh from the outside and maybe even from the inside, but this is what happens as a multi-time offender in the NHL. Kadri will likely be penalized for this crime and previous crimes and the Leafs don’t really have a replacement for him — or anyone up front who relishes the physical game and the nasty game the way Kadri does.With John Tavares signing in Toronto, Kadri’s role changed this season. His goals dropped from 32 to 16 although he seemed to accept his new situation rather handily.He played first power-play. He played with a variety of wingers. He was, as he has been since Shanahan first suspended him, a dependable player of sorts.Then came Saturday night in Boston. And not only did the Bruins clearly target the Leafs physically, they went hard at Kadri. They went at him, knowing they can get to him. There was a knee-on-knee situation with DeBrusk that probably should have been called a penalty earlier in the game. But when DeBrusk went unnecessarily hard at Patrick Marleau late in Game 2, Kadri responded both properly and recklessly.Marleau is like everyone’s father on the Leafs. You see someone abusing your father, how would you respond? Kadri lost it. He cross- checked DeBrusk, getting a major penalty and a game misconduct and whatever suspension comes down Monday.Said one Bruins coach: All Kadri had to do was lower his hands slightly. Had he cross-checked DeBrusk across the chest instead of the neck/head area, he would have got a two-minute penalty — or, the way the referees called this game, maybe no penalty at all.But he was obvious in his actions and he left the officials and the off-ice officials no choice at all and now the Leafs will play the next games — we don’t know how many — without their third-line centre on a team that doesn’t really have a fourth-line centre.There is much to like about Kadri including the size of his contract and his bold personality. But what is difficult to like is his lack of dependability in big moments and his lack of emotional maturity when it matters. In some ways, this goes back to Shanahan’s original meeting with him.“We like Nazem Kadri,” Shanahan said four years ago. “We expect a certain level of professionalism. It’s time for him to start making better decisions.”It was time then. It’s still time now.ssimmons@postmedia.comtwitter.com/simmonssteve365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

On Saturday, when rain poured for hours across North Texas, the region was at a marginal to slight risk.Weather service meteorologist Matt Stalley said expected conditions on Wednesday looked like "a classic springtime severe weather setup."  "All modes of severe weather will possible," Stalley warned, adding that damaging winds were a concern as well as the potential for large hail. Storms in the past with similar conditions have produced baseball-size hail, he said. 12:58am CDT #SPC Day2 Outlook Enhanced Risk: across parts of central/eastern oklahoma and western arkansas southwest across parts of central and eastern texas https://t.co/rEAejNHwPA pic.twitter.com/gAKyGjBfWZThe potential for flooding looked low, but Stalley said flash flooding could be possible in some areas.Based on the latest forecast models, the tornado threat for Dallas-Fort Worth is low, but it could not be ruled out, Stalley added.Storms are expected to move out of the area late Wednesday, and Dallas-Fort Worth is expected to stay dry through the weekend, Johnston said.Here’s what KXAS-TV (NBC5) has in the forecast:Wednesday: 78/65, 70 percent chance for strong stormsThursday: 70/58Friday: 75/51Saturday: 81/52Sunday: 82/60By submitting, you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

A Mississauga woman was shot with a crossbow when she answered the door to a fake delivery man in a targeted attack Peel police say they believe was carried out by a hit man and was meant to kill her.The 44-year-old victim survived the bizarre 8 p.m. attack on her front doorstep on Bayberry Dr. in the area of Winston Churchill Blvd. and Argentia Rd. on Nov. 7, but she will never be the same again, according to police."The injuries that she sustained were absolutely devastating," said Peel police Det. Sgt. Jim Kettles at a news conference. "It involved damage to a lot of her internal organs. She'll be in recovery phase for the rest of her life … Her life will never be the same."Police have released video and photographs of the suspect hoping someone in the community can help identify him. A special hotline to try to catch the would-be killer has been set up at 905-456-5840."This was most definitely a targeted type of attack," Kettles said.The victim was alone at the time and answered the door to someone dressed like a delivery man who was carrying a large package. Police said inside the box was a crossbow, the kind commonly used by hunters to kill moose and other large game. Police believe the man was holding the handle of the crossbow through a hole in one end of the box as he pointed it at the victim."The crossbow was never removed from the box," Kettles said.The victim and 'delivery man' had a brief conversation, and then the man shot her in the chest. She was able to close the door as he ran, and call 911.She saw him clearly, but did not recognize him, according to police."Comments made to the victim (by the suspect) indicate the victim was targeted and that the suspect may have carried out the attack at the request of another individual," said Supt. Heather Raymor. "It is clear that this attack was meant to end the victim's life."Police believe the man who shot her escaped in a dark coloured pickup truck.The victim spent months in hospital following the attack."We are doing everything we can to support her right now," Kettles said. "She's in a place of safety. She will continue to have a struggle to get back to her new normal, considering the injuries she sustained."He said police are ensuring her safety, and there are "potential motives" investigators have identified, but they aren't revealing any and are still looking for others."We are open to anything at this point and we are looking at all possible investigative avenues," Kettles said.He noted the suspect's baseball hat appears distinctive, although they cannot identify a make, and his shoes are also distinctive, and they are hoping his clothing or his face trigger a memory in someone.Kettles noted the suspect did not cover his face, but may have been wearing a wig under the hat.Information can also be provided to police anonymously through Peel Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 Police also released a video showing a portion of the attack.

                     The Hurricanes (25-12, 10-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) are ranked No. 22 in the Collegiate Baseball poll released Monday.
                 
  It is the first time the Hurricanes have been ranked under first-year head coach Gino DiMare.
                     Miami was 5-0 last week, beating Florida Gulf Coast in a pair of midweek games before sweeping Virginia in ACC play.
                     "We talked about it before the series began, that now is the time to make a move," DiMare said. "We have been sitting kind of on the outside, looking in, in terms of rankings, and our goal is to try and host. Nobody is giving us a chance to host, but if we make a really, really good run here, we will have a chance to do that."
                     The Hurricanes are ranked for the first time since February 2018.
                     Miami hosts Florida Gulf Coast again Tuesday before a three-game series at No. 8 Louisville.
                              Copyright 2019 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.Get email alerts for local stories and events around the world.A U.S. House bill co-sponsored by Representatives David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Doug Collins, R-Ga., aims to give newspapers a fighting chance in today’s technological world. The bill addresses the imbalance that has developed as readers have migrated from paid news sources to such free electronic news platforms as Facebook.That may sound like inside baseball, but in the balance hangs a question that matters greatly to our society: How will providers of local news keep reporting and delivering accurate information to readers?It’s becoming an existential question for news companies but also for those who care about accountability and transparency in local government, business, sports and the arts. As the bill’s text puts it, “America benefits from, and depends upon, not only a free marketplace for goods and services, but also a free marketplace of ideas.” If the news providers fade away, then users of news distributors such as Facebook and Google will be less well-informed.The Cicilline-Collins bill, known as the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would carve out the space and time needed for news providers to strike revenue-sharing terms with the dominant online news distributors.A broad array of allies, from 47 state press associations to public-interest groups such as the Open Markets Institute, support the House bill. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, acknowledges a willingness to begin paying news providers for the information — or, in digital parlance, “content” — that Facebook delivers to its users. Facebook is far and away the largest social media distributor of news.Mr. Zuckerberg said “quality journalism” plays a role in building informed communities and Facebook has the means to support it as it offers it to its users. Facebook, he said, could “potentially have a direct relationship with publishers to make sure that their content is available, if it’s really high-quality content.”Put simply, both sides — news providers and online distributors — need each other, and could move toward a financial accommodation that might serve each other’s interests. That’s encouraging, but time is of the essence, which is where the Cicilline-Collins bill comes in.It would provide a four-year “safe harbor” window for publishers to collectively negotiate terms with leading digital companies. The collective negotiation would include publishers of all sizes and types, from weekly newspapers in Eastern Massachusetts to online-only news services based in California. Its aim is to ensure that citizens who care about matters in the public interest, from local police oversight to foreign affairs, will continue to have access to reliable and informed sources of information.Consider the picture for the newspaper business: Total revenues topped $49 billion a year as recently as 2006, but fell into the $16 billion range in 2017, according to the Pew Research Center. Newsroom employment plummeted about 45 percent, to about 39,000 reporters, editors, photographers and others during the same period, Pew reports.That represents a steep decline in newspapers’ ability to cover school boards, state houses and regional affairs. Similar trends are apparent in the broadcast news industry. Less coverage, of course, means less government accountability, a disaster for our political system.The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would cost the public nothing, and could pay off in promoting high-quality news. It deserves widespread support © Copyright 2006-2019 GateHouse Media, LLC.

A vida de Amber Heard não anda fácil! Depois da notícia de que ela está sendo processada por Johnny Depp por falsas acusações no caso de abuso doméstico, agora Amber  descreveu detalhadamente na corte americana várias situações nas quais foi agredida por Johnny, seu ex-marido."Por volta de um ano dentro da relação, eu comecei a ver Johnny abusar de drogas e álcool... Em algumas ocasiões, quando ele usava narcóticos ilegais e medicações prescritas, eu tinha que chamar ajuda médica. Quando ele começava a usar, eu ficava preocupada por nós dois. Ele se tornava uma pessoa totalmente diferente, muitas vezes desiludido e violento", disse Amber, que começou a se envolver com Johnny em 2012."Nós chamávamos essa versão do Johnny de ‘O Monstro'. Johnny muitas vezes não lembrava do que fez quando voltava a ficar sóbrio. Como eu amava ele, eu acreditei nas várias promessas de que ele poderia e iria ficar melhor. Eu estava errada", desabafou a estrela.Johnny Depp processa Amber Heard em US$50 milhões e diz que ela o traiu com Elon MuskEm 2014, à bordo de um jatinho à caminho de Boston, Amber foi agredida novamente: "No voo, Johnny pediu para as aeromoças darem um tanque de oxigênio para ele e ele começou a beber bastante. Os ajudantes dele me disseram que ele estava triste por eu ter feito uma cena romântica com James Franco um dia antes. Logo, Johnny começou a tacar coisas em mim. Ao invés de reagir à atitude dele, eu mudei de lugar. Isso não parou ele. Ele começou a empurrar uma cadeira em cima de mim, para me provocar, gritava comigo e ficava gritando o nome ‘James Franco'". Em um certo ponto, eu levantei e Johnny me chutou nas costas, me fazendo cair. Ele jogou a bota dele em mim enquanto eu estava no chão. Johnny continuava a gritar obscenidades para mim até que ele foi para o banheiro do avião e desmaiou trancado pelo resto da viagem".No dia seguinte, o ator teria se desculpado com a até, então, esposa: "De novo, eu estou me sentindo envergonhado e arrependido. Me desculpe. Eu realmente não sei o que aconteceu e por que aconteceu. Mas eu jamais farei isso de novo. Minha doença veio de mansinho e me pegou... eu tenho que melhorar. De novo, eu sinto muito, muito mesmo... Eu te amo e me sinto muito mal de ter te decepcionado".Stephen Reuters, assistente do ator, também mandou uma mensagem afirmando que Johnny: "estava chocado. Quando eu disse para ele que ele te chutou, ele chorou. Ele é um garotinho perdido e precisa de toda a ajuda que puder".Apaixonada, Amber continuou no relacionamento e casou com Johnny, que supostamente estava longe das drogas, em fevereiro de 2015. No entanto, apenas um mês após o casamento, as agressões continuaram, quando a atriz pegou o então marido usando ecstasy:"Johnny me disse que eu não tinha proibido ele explicitamente de usar ecstasy. A briga foi esquentando e Johnny me empurrou, me deu um tapa e me jogou no chão antes de eu correr para um banheiro e me trancar".Na manhã seguinte, "eu desci as escadas para descobrir que Johnny ainda estava acordado e que não dormiu a noite toda, tomando oito comprimidos de MDMA. Ele também estava bebendo. Nós entramos em uma briga que Johnny tornou física. Eu me tranquei em um dos quartos. Isso não parou Johnny de arrombar a porta. No começo da noite, Johnny havia me batido várias vezes, me empurrado e me jogado no chão. Ele também me enforcou e cuspiu no meu rosto. Johnny então me deu uma garrafa de licor que estava bebendo e disse: ‘O que você vai fazer?'. Eu joguei a garrafa no chão. Johnny reagiu começando a jogar latas e garrafas de vidro fechadas em mim..."."Aquela noite, Johnny me jogou em uma mesa de ping pong que quebrou comigo em cima. Ele jogou garrafas pelos buracos de uma porta de vidro, quebrando dois painéis e deixando vidro em todo o lugar. Então ele me agarrou, apertando o meu corpo. Ele tirou meu pijama e em certo ponto eu estava pelada e descalça, coberta de álcool e vidro. Johnny me pegou pelo cabelo e me enforcou enquanto me empurrava na geladeira da cozinha. Eu tentei levantar, mas eu estava escorregando no vidro que estava no chão. Ele me jogou para longe dele e eu tentei correr, mas Johnny continuava a arremessar objetos e álcool em mim".Amber Heard revela como foi difícil falar sobre sua sexualidade com seus pais"Em uma das cenas mais assustadoras e horríveis desses três dias seguidos, Johnny me pegou pelo pescoço e me jogou em uma bancada. Eu tentava levantar enquanto ele me enforcava, mas meus braços e pernas ficavam escorregando no álcool que estava no chão e na bancada, o que me cortou inteira. Com medo por minha vida, eu disse para Johnny: ‘Você está me machucando e me cortando'. Ele me ignorou, continuando a me bater nas costas com a mão fechada e batendo com um telefone de plástico na parede com a outra mão, até ele virar pedaços. Enquanto ele batia o telefone na parede, ele machucou o dedo, cortando a ponta dele... Assim que eu sai de perto, eu me tranquei em um quarto no andar de cima. No terceiro dia que Johnny estava acordado dem dormir, eu desci e achei várias mensagens que ele tinha escrito para mim pela casa, nas paredes, nas roupas. Elas foram escritas com uma mistura de tinta à óleo e o sangue que estava em seu dedo. Ele também fez xixi na casa toda". Quando o ator foi hospitalizado, Amber estava "com o lábio cortado, o nariz inchado e cortes pelo corpo todo... até hoje, eu tenho cicatrizes no braço e nos pés por causa desse dia", contou.A estrela ainda contou detalhes sobre um episódio do qual impediu que Johnny empurrasse sua irmã mais nova da escada, agredindo-o: "Ele começou a destruir as coisas pela casa, inclusive minhas coisas que estavam no armário… Johnny ameaçou me bater, Whitney se colocou entre nós. Johnny virou a atenção para Whitney, que estava na beirada da escada, e foi para cima dela. Agindo em defesa da minha irmã, porque eu estava com medo pela saúde física, eu acertei Johnny no rosto para que a atenção dele saísse dela. Essa foi a única vez que eu bati no Johnny. Ele estava prestes a empurrar minha irmã da escada. Eu agi em defesa da vida dela".No entanto, as agressões não pararam por aí, em Agosto de 2015, durante uma viagem da Thailândia para a Malásia, "enquanto estávamos no trem Eastern Oriental, Johnny começou a brigar comigo e começou a me bater e empurrar emu ma parede, enquanto agarrava minha garganta e me segurava ali. Eu me lembro de ter ficado com medo de Johnny não saber o momento de parar e me matar".E então, mais uma briga, que rolou em dezembro de 2015, no apartamento deles em Los Angeles: "Johnny começou a brigar comigo. Ele jogou um cantil em mim, bateu em objetos do quarto e socou a parede. Ele me deu um tapa forte, agarrou meu cabelo e me arrastou pela escada do escritório até a sala de estar, depois até a cozinha, da cozinha até o quarto e então para o quarto de hóspedes. Neste processo, ele arrancou vários punhados de cabelo e cortou minha cabeça. Esperando evitar violência, eu tentei acalmá-lo e então fui para a escada, tentando me tirar da situação. Johnny me seguiu, bateu nas minhas costas, agarrou meu cabelo, me deixou em frente à escada e, então, me arrastou pelos últimos degraus. No topo da escada, Johnny me empurrou duas vezes, o que me fez ter medo de cair. Eu disse para Johnny que ele tinha quebrado meu tornozelo na tentativa dele parar. Johnny continuou me batendo e toda vez que ele me nocauteava, eu decidi apenas reagir parade e olhando para ele nos olhos. Johnny me respondeu gritando, ‘Ah, você acha que é uma porr* de um garoto durão?'. Ele recoou e socou meu rosto, acertando meu nariz, que imediatamente começou a sangrar e causou uma dor séria no meu rosto. Eu comecei a chorar e eu pensei que teria que ir ao hospital. Eu disse Johnny que eu queria deixa deixá-lo e que eu chamaria a polícia se ele tocasse em mim de novo. Quando eu comecei a sair do quarto de hóspedes, ele me bateu, me agarrou e me empurrou de quarto em quarto, segurando meu cabelo".Equipe de Amber Heard acusa Johnny Depp de fazer "abuso psicológico""Nesta hora, Johnny tinha me arrastado pela escada do escritório, eu disse para ele que eu estava deixando ele, já que não aturava mais esse comportamento dele. Johnny reagiu me agarando pela garganta, me jogando no chão e batendo na minha cabeça. Ele segurou meu cabelo, me estapeou o rosto e gritava algo como, ‘Eu vou te matar. Eu vou te matar, está me ouvindo?'. Tinha cabelo meu espalhado por todo lugar onde eu tinha sido arrastada. A briga continuous na cama. Johnny me segurou com os joelhos nas minhas costas e com o outro pé na beira da cama, enquanto me batia na cabeça repetidamente e gritava o mais alto que eu já tinha ouvido, ‘Eu te odeio', várias e várias vezes. A armação da cama quebrou por causa do peso e pressão. Johnny me bateu com os pulsos fechados e eu lembro que não conseguiua ouvir meus gritos, porque ele empurrou minha cabeça contra o colchão. Eu gritei o mais alto que podia, esperando que Johnny percebesse que estava me machucando muito"."Durante um tempo, eu não podia gritar ou respirar. Eu estava preocupada que Johnny estava totalmente num estado de cegueira e não soubesse o que estava fazendo e que ele realmente pudesse me matar. Copos quebrados e piunhados de cabelos estavam na escada… Johnny também escreveu mensagens na cozinha, que diziam, ‘Por que ser uma fraude? Tudo é uma idiotice".Para finalizar, Amber contou sobre a briga que causou a separação deles, em Maio de 2016: "Ele estava como um jogador de baseball e jogou o celular no meu rosto, o mais forte que pode. Eu gritei, ‘Você acertou meu rosto', e comecei a chorar… Johnny pegou meu cabelo e começou a me tapear, me balançar pelo local enquanto eu continuava gritando".Heard contou que um vizinho ouviu seus gritos e entrou no apartamento, se jogando entre eles, implorando para que Depp parasse, enquanto gritava, "Amber, dá o fora daqui"."Johnny jogou vários objetos pela casa, incluindo uma garrafa de vinho… Johnny jogou mais objetos no corredor, cuspiu vinho em todo lugar e fez um buraco em uma parede".Logo depois, o ator entrou em outro apartamento de Amber, "Johnny destruiu tudo que pode e perseguiu Liz Marz (maquiadora) para fora do apartamento segurando uma garrafa de vinho".Logo após isso, a atriz pediu o divórcio e como se não bastasse todo o sofrimento, ainda foi acusada de mentirosa por fãs do ator, que a ameaçam de morte até hoje em dia!

Don't forget to  "like" us on Facebook!    The Boston Red Sox were supposed to contend with the New York Yankees for the American League East title. Instead, they are 6-10 and limping into a series against the Yankees beginning Tuesday evening. Chris Sale, the team's ace, is at the heart of the matter, and if he doesn't improve soon, the Red Sox will be playing catch-up all season.Sale is 0-3 with a 9.00 ERA, his 13 earned runs in 2019 more than a third of the 37 runs he allowed over 27 starts all of last year. He is striking out a career-low 13 percent of batters faced and walking almost 7 percent, his highest rate since 2012 as a member of the Chicago White Sox. His swinging strike percentage (10.5 percent) is also at its lowest point since 2012, and hitters are making better contact against him than they have in the past four years, hitting the ball on the sweet spot of the bat once out of every 12 balls put in play.The most concerning stat for Sale, and the Red Sox, is his four-seam fastball velocity, which has tumbled from an average of 95.6 mph in 2018 to 91.5 mph this season, the most noticeable dip occurring after suffering a shoulder injury late last season. The injury could be a lingering issue but that didn't stop the team from inking the 30-year-old to a five-year, $145 million contract extension this winter.Regardless, the effectiveness of Sale's fastball is nowhere near where it needs to be right now. Batters aren't swinging as much on his fastball because Sale isn't throwing it in the zone as often - down from 53 percent to 41 percent in just one season. The swinging strike rate on this pitch is also a paltry 1.3 percent."The stuff, we know, wasn't there," Cora told Steve Hewitt of the Boston Herald. "I think the off-speed pitch is the one that, he's not consistent with it. Everyone talks about the fastball, but for me, it's the slider. It's the best slider in the game, and right now it's not that."Sale's slider, used against both right- and left-handed batters, has been a commanding pitch. From 2017 to 2018, batters hit just .181 against the pitch with 141 strikeouts over 276 at-bats. This year, batters are hitting .217 against it with four strikeouts in 23 at-bats, illustrating it is still an effective offering. And its decline is nowhere near the decline of his fastball. For example, his slider saved the team over two runs per 100 times thrown in 2018, which has dropped to break even in 2019. His fastball, on the other hand, saved the team nearly a run every 100 times thrown last year but is now costing the Red Sox six runs per 100 times thrown in 2019 - the worst rate among starting pitchers.The rest of the starting rotation also doesn't appear to be able to pick up the slack. It has a combined 6.17 FIP - a team's ERA over a given period of time if the pitcher were to have experienced league-average results on balls in play and league-average timing — second worst only to the Baltimore Orioles (6.41 FIP) largely in part to allowing 28 more runs to score than we would expect given the number of outs and men on base during each plate appearance, the most in the majors and eight more than the next worst rotation, the Chicago White Sox.Here's the bottom line: Sale was projected to be the most valuable pitcher in the AL this year (5.8 wins above replacement) and the second most valuable pitcher in the majors after New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom. Those projections have since been revised to 4.3 fWAR in 2019. One win may not sound like a lot but consider how tight the race is in the AL East. New York has a 57 percent chance to win the division with 95 wins, the Tampa Bay Rays have the next-best chance at 25 percent (91 wins) followed by Boston (18 percent, 89 wins). The Red Sox are now barely above a 50/50 chance to make the playoffs, per FanGraphs. They were given a 90 percent chance to make the playoffs at the start of the season.First published by The Washington PostAaron Beard, Ap Sports WriterRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSign up for The Whistle, the GametimeCT newsletter, to get the best, most up-to-the-minute, engaging high school sports coverage in the state.Have an existing account?Already have a subscription?Don't have an account?Get the newsLet friends in your social network know what you are reading aboutLaBelle right-hander Tyler Nesbitt, who signed with Florida, and Riverdale lefty Carson Palmquist, who committed to Miami, garnering MLB looks.A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    LaBelle RHP Tyler Nesbitt and Riverdale LHP Carson Palmquist have brought MLB teams to Southwest Florida as both already are heading to Florida and Miami respectively next fall.
    Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.comIt may have been a preseason baseball game between LaBelle and Riverdale high schools on Feb. 21, but from the throng of radar guns pointed at the field that night, it was obviously a lot more.Major League teams wanted to get a look at two of the top arms in Southwest Florida, LaBelle's Tyler Nesbitt and Riverdale's Carson Palmquist. "I definitely never imagined seeing that many people, it was packed," Nesbitt said. "I'm not used to having guys watch me throw in the bullpen, taking notes on their notepad."LaBelle pitcher Tyler Nesbitt during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers ,Tuesday, April 9, 2019. (Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Nearly every MLB club has been in the area to keep tabs on the hard-throwing Cowboys right-hander and the lanky Raiders left-hander this spring.Nesbitt's fastball has hit 94 miles per hour and he utilizes a sharp breaking ball to put hitters away. Palmquist's delivery mimics that of former FGCU star and Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale and features an upper-80s fastball and wicked curveball. More: Palmquist, Cutler power Riverdale by LaBelleThe players are committed to top in-state baseball programs, but whether they ever show up on campus will depend on what the scouts are writing in those notebooks. Palmquist committed to Miami in August 2016 and said he thinks to have the college experience and to be able to learn on and off the field is very appealing."I'd love to play in the major leagues, but I'm thinking college would be the best option," Palmquist said. "I can only get better there, throw harder, and I can learn so that if I don't ever play baseball after college, I'd still have the Miami degree. Not many people can say that. You can only go through this once, you can't go back and be a teenager again." Riverdale High School pitcher Carson Palmquist during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019. (Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Riverdale has produced three major leaguers and a number of players that played minor league baseball. Pitcher Kris Foster and outfielders Tommy Watkins and Kyle Waldrop all appeared in Big League games. Palmquist's older brother Cody pitched five seasons in the minors after graduating from Riverdale in 2012 and has been a critical influence on Carson.Riverdale head baseball coach Rob Pringle puts Palmquist at the top of the list of pitchers he has had in his 24 years with the Raiders but highlighted one thing that separates Palmquist."He's a competitor, he just loves to compete," Pringle said. "I've had a chance to have a lot of kids here, and he's as good as I've had."A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Palmquist has been dominant so far this season, going 5-1 while throwing 35 2/3 innings entering this week with 66 strikeouts and has allowed just six hits with an 0.79 ERA. He also threw a no-hitter with 15 strikeouts against Naples on March 26. LaBelle head baseball coach Jeff Burton touts Nesbitt as the shining example he wants his team to aspire to be. "It's just nice to have a kid that has worked hard and everybody knows that he's worked hard and sees that, 'Hey, it can work out here'," Burton said. "We have our saying out there of don't let being good get in the way of being great. He has worked hard and not been satisfied."Originally committing to Florida Gulf Coast as a sophomore, Nesbitt had an outstanding summer campaign participating in Perfect Game baseball events before the start of his senior year. Reaching into the low-90s with his fastball, bigger schools began calling and Nesbitt made the tough call to de-commit from his hometown team.LaBelle pitcher Kyle Nesbitt during the Battle of the Boarder Baseball Tournament in  Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019. (Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)At the WWBA Championship in Jupiter, Nesbitt had 10 strikeouts in five innings in one outing that led to him being named the tournament's top pitcher. As a lifelong Florida Gators fan, an offer was extended immediately which Nesbitt quickly accepted and signed. Whether or not Nesbitt makes it to Gainesville will be decided by June's MLB Draft. "There's no bad decision for me," said Nesbitt, listed in Baseball America's Top 100 prospects. "I'd have way more resources at Florida than I would here, and I can only better myself. Florida's been my dream school, I'm a diehard Gator fan."Nesbitt has delivered this year for LaBelle, going 6-1 with a 1.08 ERA and three no-hitters over 39 innings pitched. He has thrown six complete games, striking out 69 with five walks and six earned runs allowed.The pitchers hope to finish their high school careers with long playoff runs. That would set up higher profile matchups against some of Florida's best teams, which could provide another chance to boost their draft stocks. Nesbitt pointed to a matchup with North Broward Prep in the playoffs last year, that featured 38th overall pick Xavier Edwards.Riverdale High School pitcher Carson Palmquist during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019. (Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Riverdale could possibly face defending 7A champion Venice which would be a huge test for Palmquist. "Making the Final Four has been my ultimate goal for four years," Palmquist said. "This year, our team is so close, we all hang out all the time and we're good friends. I think we're going to be able to make a far run."   CHICAGO — Snow and rain led to the postponement of Sunday's finale of a three-game series between the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.A makeup date was not immediately announced.A steady snow fell throughout the morning and a mix of snow and rain was forecast to continue throughout the afternoon.Right-hander Tyler Chatwood (0-0, 6.00 ERA) was scheduled to make his first start of the season on Sunday for Chicago. He will pitch Monday night when the Cubs open a three-game series at Miami.Right-hander Trevor Cahill (1-1, 3.50 ERA) will start for the Angels in the opener of a three-game series at Texas on Monday night.

		Powered by WordPress.com VIP Ken Powtak, Associated PressCaptionCloseBOSTON (AP) — Chris Davis knows his homer went a lot further than teammate Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-run shot. He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot — estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's — projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name — 'Crush' — for a reason."Renato Núñez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vázquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velázquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vázquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vázquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSign up for The Whistle, the GametimeCT newsletter, to get the best, most up-to-the-minute, engaging high school sports coverage in the state.NEW YORK — Ravaged by injuries, the New York Yankees hardly resemble the 100-win team that set a major league record for homers last year.And even though it's very early in the season, they are frittering away games during a favorable portion of their schedule.Tim Anderson hit his first career grand slam and Carlos Rodón pitched the Chicago White Sox to a 5-2 victory over the scuffling Yankees on Sunday. New York is 3-6 at home against the Orioles, Tigers and White Sox — all projected also-rans that lost at least 98 games last year."It's frustrating to lose two out of three to a team that we should probably beat," first baseman Luke Voit said. "I think a lot of us just need to get out of our heads and go back to playing Yankee baseball the right way."Rodón (2-2) allowed three hits in six innings and struck out five , improving to 3-0 in three starts at Yankee Stadium. He retired his final 11 batters after a visit from pitching coach Don Cooper.Four relievers finished a four-hitter, with Alex Colomé getting three quick outs for his third save."I found a groove after the third," Rodón said. "This is a playoff club, the Yankees are. I think this is a good series win for us. Hopefully we can build off it and get some momentum going."

More than 2,000 eggs were placed in two age division hunts. They were quickly snapped up.“Nothing brings out children's adventurous side more than an egg hunt, and we’re excited to host a unique version of this time-honored tradition,” said Peter Abraham, general manager of Lincolnwood Town Center. “This is just one way we’re utilizing our space to create interactive events for our community.”Colorful pastel seasonal stuffed animals were seen tucked with eggs for children to also discover.Lori Odeste of Skokie, mother of Maia, 3, said the event was, “awesome.”“We came last year,” Odeste said, “That’s why we came back again this year. That’s what we like about coming here to Lincolnwood.

James Stack, killed in action in Afghanistan. “Just having a room full of people giving back and giving them a way to give back. The charity starts with the veterans because they give us the freedom of speech, and the freedom to come and go as we please.”Volunteers met April 7 to pack the boxes.VFW Post 981 Commander Steve MacInnes, who served in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, remembers the boxes he received while serving.“What it means to them is everything. When you’re overseas and you’re in combat, you like to receive things from home when you can,” he said. “To be able to send out over 1,000 boxes to troops overseas, we’re showing them we still care about them and they’re important to us.”Hedrick accepted thousands of donations in 45 collection boxes in towns from Fox Lake to Park Ridge and also in the police departments of Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Lake Zurich and Barrington.She asked volunteers on April 7 to pack each box “with love” and Girl Scout cookies, snacks, candy, toiletries, socks, dice, cards, little travel games, three to four letters from kids and a letter from the Hedrick and Stack families.Hedrick received 53 military addresses to which she will ship 20 boxes for distribution to others who haven’t received anything from home. Shipping will cost  more than $17,000. She’s still accepting donations at the charity’s website helpusatroops.com.Since 2011, Help USA Troops has sent more than 4,300 packages, according to organizers.“I don’t think we do enough as a community, I don’t think we do enough as a country,” Hedrick said. “They’re serving our country, they’re risking their lives and their families are risking everything for us.”Her daughter Katie Stack was only 19 with 1-year-old daughter Mikayla when she lost James, her husband of just over a year, six weeks after he was deployed in September 2010. She feels his loss during the packing event.“It doesn’t hit me until we gather around and we see the color guard and the national anthem plays, I will come to the realization that all of these individuals are here to honor my husband  and to just support all of the troops who have their lost their lives and given the ultimate sacrifice,” said Stack, adding she has many military friends who have returned as amputees who also need to be recognized.“I like how my mom started this, how much it’s grown and knowing we can keep his memory alive and give back. Knowing all these people do it in memory of him and in honor of our troops, it helps me.”Stack and her daughter were the first to pack a box, followed by other Gold Star families and volunteers who  worked their way around an assembly line packed with goodies.MacInnes’ post, which meets at the Amvets in Wheeling, has been actively supporting this event since it started.“In my opinion, this is what it’s all about, to honor our veterans and those who are no longer with us and to give to our troops overseas,” MacInnes said. “That’s done in remembrance of James, but it also has such a deep meaning to us, as veterans of foreign wars. We think it’s extremely important that we never forget those who have sacrificed their lives.”State Rep. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, and state Sen. Ann Gillespie, D-Arlington Heights, joined volunteers packing boxes.“People are still serving and dying overseas and they’re not to be forgotten,” said Walker, who served in the Army during the Vietnam War. “They’re so many sacrifices that we tend to not remember. They love getting packages, at least I did. It’s really important … and there’s nothing like Girl Scout cookies.”Added Gillespie: “We forget people have been over in Afghanistan for 20 years.”Joe Fox, 17, joined his Buffalo Grove High School baseball teammates in loading boxes onto a truck.“I thought this was a good way to give back and do it with some of my teammates,” he said.Hedrick plans to continue her mission.“We’ll keep doing this until they all come home,” Hedrick told the crowd, giving next year’s dates of April 25-26. “I don’t see this ending any time soon.”Elizabeth Owens-Schiele is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.AdvertisementSupported byBy Kevin ArmstrongPHILADELPHIA — With Noah Syndergaard set to start the series opener against the Phillies on Monday, Mets Manager Mickey Callaway stood in his office, and noted that Jacob deGrom, the starter in the previous night’s loss, had reviewed video of the defeat.“Jake looked at it for about 45 minute last night and saw some stuff that he feels like can help him,” Callaway said.After not giving up a run in his first two starts, deGrom, who posted a 1.70 earned run average as the Cy Young Award winner in the National League last season, has yielded a combined nine runs in his last two outings, both of which resulted in losses.DeGrom can now pass the remote control to Syndergaard, who will be seeking his own answers after giving up five earned runs in five innings during the Mets’ 7-6 victory in 11 innings at Citizens Bank Park. Once again, it was the Mets’ offense that bailed out the pitching to improve the team’s record to 10-6 on the season.“We got away with some stuff tonight, but we still came up with a win,” Callaway said. “That says a lot.”Relief pitchers Jeurys Familia and Robert Gsellman will also want to take a closer look at their work after their struggles on Monday night. Familia inherited a 6-5 lead in the eighth inning before loading the bases and being replaced by Gsellman, who proceeded to walk in a run on four pitches to tie the score.“It feels really good to win that one,” Syndergaard said. “I didn’t necessarily do my job, but the offense did a really good job of getting to a really talented pitcher early. I did a pretty good job of giving those runs back.”Catcher Wilson Ramos, left fielder/third baseman Jeff McNeil and second baseman Robinson Cano all drove in at least one run, and center fielder Brandon Nimmo put the Mets ahead, 6-5, with his third home run of the season in the top of the sixth.In the top of the 11th, Juan Lagares reached base on an infield hit and eventually scored when Phillies first baseman Rhys Hoskins couldn’t handle Michael Conforto’s sharp grounder. Hoskins was charged with an error on the play.“I saw he didn’t catch the ball, so I go with everything I got,” Lagares said.McNeil, who was 3 for 5 at the plate, made the biggest defensive play of the game, diving to to his left in the bottom of the eighth to snare a ball that was rocketed at him by Phillies third baseman Maikel Franco and then turn it into a double play. The play by McNeil, which came with runners on first and second and no one out, kept the Phillies from a potentially big inning that would have decided the game, although Philadelphia ended up tying the score, anyway.Afterward, McNeil maintained that the extra-inning win over a division rival was a statement the win-now Mets needed to make.“They’re a good team,” he said, “and we’re a great team.”In any case, the night ended with a victory for the Mets. And here is where things stand with them over all:Command has been a concern.Jason Vargas, the fifth starter, has started two games, was skipped in the rotation once and made a relief appearance in the ninth inning of a loss. By the time he got out of that inning, he had given up four more earned runs. His earned run average is currently 14.21.Pitching was billed as the Mets’ strength heading into the season, but all five starters have had issues with their feel for the ball or efficiency thus far.Steven Matz provided a bright spot over the weekend, as he limited the Braves to two earned runs in six innings and picked up his first win of the season. He struck out eight.But with Vargas showing little to be optimistic about and deGrom unable to keep up the pace of his first two starts — let alone his 2018 season — plenty of fans are already calling for the Mets to sign Dallas Keuchel, the free agent starter who is available if the Mets are willing to write another check.Edwin Diaz, known as Sugar, came in to collect his sixth save, and his E.R.A. is down to 1.35. Callaway noted afterward that he will not use Diaz for more than three outs on the road unless necessary.“When we get to the playoffs, he will be available for more than three outs,” Callaway said. “We have faith in our other guys.”The rest of the relievers, though, have been underwhelming. Seth Lugo has surrendered six runs in 10 and two-thirds innings. Familia has two wins despite a 6.84 E.R.A. Gsellman had already blown a save before walking in the run against the Phillies.On Monday, righty Drew Gagnon was recalled from Syracuse. “We’re kind of strapped for pitching,” Callaway said.Three Mets — McNeil, Pete Alonso and Ramos — are ranked in the top 10 of the National League for batting average. While McNeil (.404) continues to make contact with almost anything thrown his way, Alonso (.339) has quickly established himself as much more than just a long-ball threat, though he does have six home runs already. The steady stroke of Ramos (.320) has kept the order moving on multiple occasions.Nimmo received a wake-up call when he was dropped in the lineup from leadoff to eighth on Friday, and he responded by going 3 for 4 with a homer and a double. He has continued to hit since.Cano had struggled since homering and driving in an insurance run on opening day. Heading into Monday night’s game, he was 3 for his last 24 and batting .183 on the year, but he doubled in the top of the fourth inning against the Phillies to drive in two runs.“He’ll be fine,” Callaway said.When Todd Frazier and Jed Lowrie went down with injuries early in camp, the Mets knew they had bodies to fill in — they just didn’t know how well those bodies would perform.Dominic Smith has adjusted to his bench role very well, both as a late-inning defensive replacement for Alonso at first base and as a pinch-hitter. He is batting .421.J.D. Davis, who has played at third, provided power with his two-homer game against the Washington Nationals at home on April 6 and with another shot in Atlanta on Sunday night. He has started to take fly balls in left field in order to get comfortable there for possible assignments.While the team’s versatility is evident and depth concerns have been addressed, Callaway and company know it is time for the established stars — like deGrom, Cano and Syndergaard — to perform the way they are expected to in order to compete for the N.L. East title.AdvertisementWeekend Sports: West K’s 12 at Cost FieldRedshirt junior Derek West (46) struck out 12 Wake Forest batters in 6.0 frames.

By  Alexa Marzina, Staff Writer April 15, 2019While many of Pitt’s teams didn’t earn their desired end result, the weekend still provided standout moments across Panther athletics, including a record-setting performance at Charles L. Cost field and the final regular-season match played by Pitt’s tennis team. Elsewhere, the track and field team saw several of its athletes reach the podium while softball suffered another sweep at Georgia Tech.TrackPitt’s track team split up to cover some ground over the weekend, with some members heading down to Knoxville for the Tennessee Invitational from Thursday to Saturday while others went to Bucknell University for the Bison Outdoor Classic, which ran from Saturday to Sunday. The Panthers managed to land several athletes on the podium at each location.First-years Crockett Schooler and Sydni Townsend led the Knoxville faction on Friday, with the former taking third in the men’s 400-meter hurdles in 53.11 seconds and the latter taking second in the women’s 400-meter hurdles with a time of 58.89 — a new personal record and the fourth-fastest time in program history.At Bucknell, sophomore Daveon Finley led the Panthers with a gold-medal finish in the 110-meter hurdles, finishing in 14.74 seconds. Sophomore Greg Lauray also continued his standout season, claiming silver in the high jump with a 2.04-meter leap. Other contributors included senior Makenzie Zeh, who finished third in the women’s mile with a 4:59.90, and fifth-year Nick Sloan, who set a season best and finished eighth in the men’s 1,500-meter run with a 3:46.13.Next up, Pitt’s entire team will come together for the Virginia Challenge in Charlottesville, Virginia, running from Friday to Saturday.SoftballThe Panthers got swept on the road this weekend by Georgia Tech in a series of contests that didn’t even see any seventh-inning action from the Yellow Jackets.Friday’s affair stayed scoreless until the fourth inning, when sophomore Hunter Levesque nailed a leadoff hit to put Pitt on the board. Georgia answered in the fifth with five runs of its own — four being due to an infield error — and the Panthers couldn’t recover, losing 5-2.Saturday saw a more competitive side of the Panthers early, earning one run each in four innings. First-year pitcher Abby Edwards earned four strikeouts in the first four innings before being replaced with senior Taylor Rahach, who notched one of her own.Even with Pitt’s consistent scoring, the Yellow Jackets overpowered the Panthers, gaining five points combined from the fifth and sixth innings, leading to a Pitt loss in the bottom of the sixth, 6-4. Ready for the comeback later that day, Pitt put up seven runs within the first two innings in its second game, promising for a big Panther win.But the Panthers went scoreless the rest of the game, while the Yellow Jackets earned six, five and five points in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, respectively. Georgia Tech’s lead earned a mercy rule victory, 19-8, dropping the Panthers to 7-36 on the season.Pitt returns home to Vartabedian Field Tuesday at 5 p.m. to try to break its four-game losing streak, facing 18-20 Kent State.BaseballPitt baseball fared slightly better than softball but couldn’t seal the deal against Wake Forest in its series this weekend, falling two games to one at home, slipping to 10-24 on the season. Redshirt junior pitcher Derek West was Friday night’s star, earning 12 strikeouts in six innings, the highest of all Pitt pitchers this season and a tie for the record from any Pitt pitcher at Charles L. Cost Field. The Panthers’ offense got off to a hot start, making it a seven-point game by the end of the fifth, including two RBIs each from sophomore Ron Washington Jr., senior Connor Perry and junior Nico Popa.The Demon Deacons tried to make the comeback, earning three runs combined in the sixth and seventh innings, but couldn’t put anything else up on the board, ending the contest in Pitt’s favor, 8-3. But the next day didn’t fare as well for the Panthers, as they lost both games in their doubleheader.Pitt started off solid in the first game by gaining a 3-0 lead by the second inning, but Wake Forest answered with four runs in the fourth, gaining the advantage and keeping it through the duration of the game while all the Panthers could do was chip away at the deficit, ending the afternoon with a 20-8 loss.Using that momentum, Wake Forest led the second game of the day with a six-run second inning and keeping the Panthers low on the scoring front. Pitt seemed to be coming back in the sixth, with a two-run double from sophomore Bryce O’Farrell, but it wasn’t enough as Pitt fell again, 7-6.The Panthers have the opportunity to avenge their recent home losses with another contest at Charles L. Cost Field against Youngstown State Tuesday at 3 p.m.TennisIn its final scheduled regular-season game in program history, Pitt women’s tennis dropped to 0-14 against conference opponents and 4-17 overall, having not won a contest since Feb. 16. The No. 22 Demon Deacons bested the Panthers at Wake Forest Tennis Complex Sunday, 4-1.Pitt only earned one win each in singles and doubles competition. Senior Clara Lucas and sophomore Camila Moreno snagged a doubles victory, besting Wake Forest’s Anna Ulyashchenko and Joanna Zalewski, 6-3. Singles competitor senior Natsumi Okamoto got the best of Anna Brylin in their first contest, 6-2, and earned the win after Brylin retired during the second game.The Panthers start their postseason Wednesday against Notre Dame in the ACC Championships in Cary, North Carolina, at 2:30 p.m.Tags: baseball, derek west, marzina, softball, tennis, track, weekend sportsAlexa is a senior pursuing an English writing degree and a certificate in American Sign Language.

The worms were found in Central Florida, more than 100 miles away from where Burmese pythons have been reported in the southern part of the state.Even though the worms were found in the northern part of the state, that doesn't mean there are pythons there, according to a recent study. Researchers say the parasites traveled so far by hitching riders in reptiles and other host animals that Florida snakes eat. Officials say there is a risk of the worms spreading to other states."At this point, they are moving very rapidly. They are certainly in Brevard County," said Terence Farrell, a biologist at Stetson University. "It's conceivable they will spread throughout the whole United States."While dissecting three pygmy rattlesnakes, researches found the parasites in the lungs and tracheas of the animals. One of the worms was reportedly as wide as the snake's trachea and could have obstructed the snake's airway.Researchers say the bloodsucking parades aren't thought to be a health risk to humans.These findings were published in the Herpetological Review.Editor’s note: Fourth in a series of 10 personality stories on the top 10 academic students in the Loudonville High School Class of 2019. Sports. The outdoors. A big family. Great grades. All of these factors influenced Joe Henley in his formative years growing up in Loudonville. However, Henley, one of the top 10 academic students in this year’s senior class with a 3.88 academic average, has chosen business as his career field as he takes his next step, going to college at the University of Akron. "I worked the past two summers at the Go Karts at Mohican Adventures, and I found, on the job, that I really enjoyed dealing with people," he said. "I think I would be happy and successful in a business career that centers on dealing with people." His summer job at Mohican Adventures also influenced his college choice. "A couple of guys I worked with go there and told me the programs there are awesome, and I confirmed that in my studies of various college. Akron has an outstanding business program." Henley’s favorite subjects at LHS were the biological sciences. "I really enjoyed Mr. David Spreng’s Biology II class because of the outdoor work we did in it, like taxonomy," he said. "In fact, I have always enjoyed doing things outdoors." He also loves sports. At LHS, Henley has earned four letters in basketball and baseball, three in soccer, and one in football, and commented, "of the sports, I think I like basketball the best, even though I am not as good at it as baseball." Henley also grew up in a big family, as the fifth of six children of Chuck and Rita Henley of Loudonville. His eldest sister, Lauren Davis, 34, is a teacher in Columbus; Twila Soles, 33, who lives in Colorado and is a craft beer brewer; Will, 22, also in Columbus where he drives truck for Amazon; Liz, 20, who recently graduated from college at the Bradford School in Columbus; and James, 14, an eighth-grader. Asked if any individual had a major influence on his life, he immediately mentioned his older brother Will. "We were very close when we were younger, and he taught me to play, and enjoy, all sports," he said. At LHS, he cited social studies teacher Eric Stoner as the most influential. "I took a college level politics class from him, and learned a lot about politics and government, and in the process, he shared a lot of knowledge and experience about a lot of other subjects," Henley said. Last year, as a junior, he took four College Credit Plus courses, two math and two social studies, but this year he is sticking just with LHS classes. "Among them this year are calculus and physics, both pretty tough classes," he said. In addition to all the sports, Henley is a member of the high school’s Leo Club and the National Honor Society. He was captain of the basketball team this year, and is a member of St. Peter Catholic Church.

Ad Choices  RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTo read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.Apps: Apple Podcasts |

He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot — estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's — projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name — 'Crush' — for a reason."Renato Núñez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vázquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velázquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vázquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vázquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTo read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.Apps: Apple Podcasts |

Citigroup slipped after its own earnings report. Banks are leading off an earnings-reporting season that analysts expect to be the weakest in nearly three years.The S&P 500 slipped 1.83 points, or 0.1%, to 2,905.58. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, and the Nasdaq composite edged down 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks fell 5.63, or 0.4%, to 1,579.17.The S&P 500 is still within 0.9% of the record high it set in September. It has had a torrid start to the year after the Federal Reserve said it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019.“I think we’re going to see equities continue to confound their critics and advance,” said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management.She expects growth for both the economy and corporate earnings to re-accelerate later this year, in large part because of the Federal Reserve’s pledge to hit pause on interest-rate hikes. That follows seven interest-rate increases in the last two years, including the last one in December, that raised worries about a possible recession and helped send the S&P 500 to a nearly 20% loss at one point.“If you look through history, recessions have been precipitated by the Federal Reserve tightening and causing recessions — telling banks, ‘Don’t make loans,’ and pulling out liquidity,” she said. “This time, they got right up to the brink, and when the market had that violent reaction in December, that made them rethink their approach.”Optimism has also grown that the United States and China can resolve their trade dispute. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Saturday that the world’s two largest economies were moving closer to an agreement.Some of the market’s biggest losses Monday came from the financial sector. Lighter trading activity during the first three months of the year meant that Goldman Sachs’ revenue fell short of analysts’ estimates. Its shares slid 3.8%.Like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup also reported stronger first-quarter profit than analysts expected. Its stock slipped 0.1%.Alliance Data Systems sank 9.3%, the largest loss in the S&P 500, after it agreed to sell its Epsilon business to Publicis Groupe for $4.4 billion in cash. That price was less than what some analysts had valued the business at.On the winning side was Waste Management, which jumped 2.4% after it agreed to buy its smaller rival, Advanced Disposal, for $3 billion. It will also assume $1.9 billion of debt in the deal. Advanced Disposal surged 17.9%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.55%. It has been climbing since late last month, when it fell to 2.37% amid a crescendo of worries that global economic growth was slowing.In the commodities markets, the price of oil gave back some of its big gains for the year. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 49 cents to settle at $63.40. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 37 cents to $71.18. Both remain up more than 30% for the year.Natural gas slipped 7 cents to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. Heating oil slipped a penny to $2.06 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline fell 3 cents to $2.01 a gallon.Gold fell $3.90 to $1,291.30 an ounce. Silver rose 1 cent to $14.98 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.94 a pound.The dollar fell to 112.03 yen from 112.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1304 from $1.1296. The British pound rose to $1.0041 from $1.0029.By Nate RaymondBOSTON (Reuters) - Actress Lori Loughlin on Monday entered a not guilty plea to charges that she participated in a wide-ranging college admissions scam by paying bribes to get her two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California.Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom "Full House," and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.California college admissions consultant William "Rick" Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.Prosecutors allege that Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC's crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including "Desperate Housewives" TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Tom Brown)(Reuters) - The man accused of seriously injuring a 5-year-old boy by throwing him from a balcony at Minnesota's Mall of America last week told investigators he had initially intended to kill an adult, but it did not "work out," prosecutors said on Monday.Emmanuel Aranda, who police said has a history of mental issues and arrests on relatively minor charges, went to the mall last Thursday and left without following through on his plan, the Hennepin County Attorney's office said in a statement.He returned on Friday when he picked the boy and threw him from the building's third tier, it said.Police have not identified the boy, but said he suffered life-threatening injuries after falling nearly 40 feet (12 meters) at the Bloomington mall, a major tourist attraction in the state.In a GoFundMe post that has so far raised more than $570,000 for the child's medical expenses, a friend of the family identified as Noah Hanneman of Woodbury, Minnesota, said on Sunday that the boy, whom he identified by his first name Landon, was still fighting for his life."He had a peaceful sleep and is still continuing to fight his courageous battle," Hanneman said. "He's a strong survivor!"Aranda, 24, of Minneapolis, will face attempted premeditated first-degree murder charges when he makes his first court appearance on Tuesday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement. Prosecutors will ask that bail be set at $2 million, Freeman said."That a child, with his mother, at a safe public area like a mall, could be violently attacked for no reason is chilling for everyone," Freeman said. "We charged Mr. Aranda with the most severe crime that the evidence allowed."Aranda told investigators that he knew what he was planning to do was wrong, prosecutors said in the complaint. They said he lashed out aggressively after years of coming to the mall to try to speak with women and being rejected.After throwing the boy from the balcony, Aranda fled the scene but was arrested elsewhere at the mall a short time later, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said on Friday. [nL1N21U1UO]Aranda had been arrested by Bloomington police three times in 2015, including once after he threw an object from the third level at the mall, Potts told reporters on Saturday.Some of Aranda's previous arrests were heard in mental health court, Potts added.(Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)Published: April 15, 2019 Updated: April 15, 2019 3:47 PM EDT Filed Under:As the Ottawa 67’s await the start of the third round of the OHL playoffs – they will open the series at The Arena at TD Place Thursday and Saturday – they’ve been busy signing key pieces of the future.The 67’s announced the signings of top draft picks Jack Matier, Jack Beck and Brenden Sirizzotti.Matier, a 6-2, 174-pound defenceman chosen 21st overall in the OHL draft, scored 10 goals and 11 assists in 21 games with the minor midget Soo Thunderbirds in 2018-19.Beck, a left winger, netted 33 goals and 41 assists in 73 games with the minor midget Toronto Marlboros this season.Sirizzotti registered 32 goals and 61 assists in 32 games with the Whitby Wildcats in 2018-19.As for the current playoff run, the 67’s will play the winner of the Oshawa-Niagara series.

For Senators fans, their success is a bit like pouring salt into the wound of painful trades.

Pittsburgh Penguins’ Phil Kessel (81) cannot get a shot past New York Islanders goaltender Robin Lehner (40) with Islanders’ Ryan Pulock (6) also defending during the second period in Game 3 of an NHL first-round hockey playoff series in Pittsburgh, Sunday, April 14, 2019.

–Lehner, once upon a time deemed the Senators goaltender of the future, has backstopped his New York Islanders to a commanding 3-0 series lead over the Pittsburgh Penguins.–Duchene, who originally came to the Senators in the hopes of realizing his wish of an extended playoff run, has become the offensive leader for a Columbus Blue Jackets team on the verge of knocking out the Tampa Bay Lightning in what could go down as one of the most colossal upsets in NHL history.–Stone, meanwhile, went into Monday’s action atop the NHL playoff scoring race, fresh from the first hat trick of his career – that’s right, he never scored one during his stellar career in Ottawa – in giving his Vegas Golden Knights a 2-1 series lead over the San Jose Sharks.

The Golden Knights defeated the Sharks 6-3 to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

In the big picture of the sporting world, of course, it was Tiger’s weekend; a remarkable comeback to the top of the golfing world.Yet just as the Woods celebration was calming down late in the afternoon, Lehner was being heralded for yet another stellar performance in the Islanders net, stopping 25 of 26 shots. Lehner owns a 1.62 goals against average, with a .951 save percentage.For those who forget the history, Lehner lost his spot in the Senators organizational depth chart in 2015, sitting out with a concussion during the remarkable Hamburglar run.He was then traded to the Buffalo Sabres, along with David Legwand and his contract, for the first-round draft pick that eventually became current centre Colin White.

Signed as a free agent by the Islanders last summer, Lehner’s personal recovery from addiction to booze and pills, a bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts, had made him the leading candidate to win the Bill Masterton Trophy.Now, he’s pouring playoff gravy on all of that. Before the current post-season run, Lehner had only 49 minutes of NHL playoff experience, mop-up duty in a series against the Penguins while with the Senators in 2013.If the Islanders 3-0 edge on the Penguins can be considered a major surprise, the Duchene-led Blue Jackets advantage on the Lightning is akin to David taking down Goliath.

Only 1:44 into Sunday’s game, Duchene scored to set off the infamous Columbus cannon, setting the tone for what became a 3-1 victory and the commanding 3-0 series lead. Duchene leads the Blue Jackets in playoff scoring, with two goals and three assists.Playoff success is what Duchene hoped for when the Senators made the colossal deal to acquire him in 2017.As difficult as it is for Senators fans to watch, there is a potential silver lining. Should an extended Blue Jackets playoff run – they’ve yet to win a single post-season series since joining the NHL in 2000 – lead to Duchene signing a long-term contract extension, the Senators will receive an additional first round draft pick in 2020. In the original trade deadline deal, the Senators also received the Blue Jackets 2019 first-round pick, along with prospects Vitaly Abramov and Jonathan Davidson.

As Duchene and company were basking in the Sunday victory, Stone was just getting started in Vegas.A mere 16 seconds into Game 3, Stone opened the scoring with a breakaway backhand goal over the shoulder of Sharks goaltender Martin Jones.He finished off the Sharks with a pair of third period goals, along with a pair of second period assists, to complete a five-point night. For those not still awake as Sunday turned to Monday, the wild Stone jubilation would have seemed familiar to Senators fans who have seen his emotional outbursts in the past.

The Golden Knights defeated the Sharks 6-3 to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

The return for Stone included star 19-year-old defenceman Erik Brannstrom, who could join the Senators as early as next season. The Senators also received a 2020 second-round draft pick and centre Oscar Lindberg, who had a strong finish to the regular season in Ottawa, but likely isn’t going to re-sign here in the summer.That’s the future the Senators have to bank on from losing Stone.For now, though, Stone has six goals and two assists in three games, his name and photo front and centre where NHL.com lists its statistical leaders. The line of Stone, Max Pacioretty and Paul Stastny, who all came from elsewhere this season, has combined for 10 goals and 12 assists in a mere three games.

If it’s any consolation to Senators fans, it’s that all three of Stone’s goals came with former Senators captain Erik Karlsson on the ice, unable to contain him and the rest of the Golden Knights.Karlsson has five points in three games and is tied with Winnipeg’s Dustin Byfuglien for the playoff scoring lead among defencemen, but Karlsson and the Sharks have struggled defensively.Seemingly, everywhere you look in the NHL playoffs, there’s a Senators connection somewhere.kwarren@postmedia.comTwitter: @Citizenwarren ALSO IN THE NEWSAfter 48 years and over 1,000 games, a rec-league hockey player joins the 500 clubVideo: Notre-Dame Cathedral on fireBack to the future as Redblacks hire Joe PaopaoWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

Aunque el divorcio no ha concluido, Angelina Jolie y Brad Pitt ya son legalmente solteros.En septiembre de 2016, la actriz de 43 años presentó documentos para poner fin al matrimonio con Pitt.El portal E! News confirmó que un juez de Los Ángeles emitió el viernes una sentencia bifurcada, que permite a Jolie y Pitt volver a ser legalmente solteros antes de finalizar el divorcio y el acuerdo de custodia permanente. La noticia fue reportada por primera vez por el portal The Blast.Jolie y Pitt no han comentado al respecto.Después de la solicitud de divorcio, los actores que estuvieron involucrados románticamente durante más de una década iniciaron una batalla por la custodia de sus seis hijos: Maddox, 17; Pax, 15; Zahara, 14; Shiloh, 12; y los gemelos Vivienne y Knox, de 10 años. A finales de 2018, llegaron a un acuerdo de custodia temporal, indica el portal especializado en entretenimiento.Una fuente le dijo a E! News que Jolie estaba “contenta de estar entrando en la siguiente etapa y se siente aliviada con el progreso en la salud de la familia”.Sin embargo, una segunda fuente aseguró que Pitt no encontraba la situación “ideal”, y agregó: “Hay un acuerdo vigente, pero no es un acuerdo permanente. Todavía hay un largo camino por delante”.“Brad espera que lo peor haya quedado atrás...”, dijo otra fuente. “A la larga, sabe que los niños son mejores con su mamá y su papá en su vida. Ahora puede seguir adelante y tratar de ser una influencia positiva, estable y constante en sus vidas”.Aunque duraron más de una década juntos, “Brangelina”, como se conoce a Jolie y Pitt, y quienes fueron en su momento la pareja de Hollywood, se casaron en 2014 y se separaron en 2016.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.   Diario Libre, 2018 © Todos los derechos reservados | Avisos Legal | Ficha Técnica | Contacto |Lauren Graver was a 7-year-old second grader at Lions Park Elementary School student when she was admitted to the hospital for cancer treatment and was provided with a rainbow-patterned fleece blanket that served as a comfort to her.Her teachers and classmates recognized this comfort and began a blanket-making event entitled Knots of Love to help other children with pediatric cancer, according to a school district press release.According to her mother, Lauren participated in the first two years of Knot of Love. She died in December 2017, months before the third one would get underway. Lauren succumbed to rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of cancer that targets muscle, tendons, cartilage and bones.“It's still surreal to think Lauren is gone, and we feel her absence every day, and so very strongly at Knots of Love,” said Amy Graver, Lauren’s mother.This year’s community event was hosted March 15 at Prospect High School, where two of Lauren’s siblings attend. The school in Mt. Prospect is part of the Arlington Heights-based Township High School District 214.Participants were encouraged to bring materials such as fleece to assemble blankets, and Amy Graver said that some 580 blankets were made. She said she got over 100 more after the event at the school.In total, more than 700 Knots of Love blankets were expected to be delivered this year by the Graver family to the pediatric cancer unit at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, the mother said.She said “kids having surgeries and kids with overnight or long term hospital stays” would receive a blanket. They would be distributed to patients from 1 year old to 18.“It’s really cool to see how many people support our family and want to make blankets in honor of Lauren,” said Claire Graver, a freshman at Prospect High School and Lauren’s older sister.To continue to honor Lauren’s memory, the Graver family has created the Lauren Graver Memorial Scholarship, which aims to provide a minimum of $500 annually to a graduating Prospect High School senior who intends to pursue a career in journalism.Amy Graver said that, starting this year, the family sold T-shirts to fund the scholarship. Lauren’s brother Connor and sister Claire designed the shirts.“We are thrilled we have another avenue to continue Lauren's legacy of kindness,” she said.The award is meant for a student who has demonstrated leadership and hard work within the field of journalism at Prospect High School or with its school news outlet, The Prospector.“Every year we’re surprised more and more with how many people come out and how many people care about our family,” said Connor Graver, a senior at Prospect High School.The school’s Guitar Club sponsors Knots of Love.“We have a goal here of being more involved in service and of getting the community involved,” said Dr. Jay Kyp-Johnson, the school’s psychologist and sponsor of the Guitar Club.Amy Graver said she and her family remain grateful for the outpouring of support.“We look back at her interview from the second year when she said she wants blankets so she can make other kids feel at home as she did,” Amy Graver said of Lauren. “That's why we continue this. Lauren wanted to be the sick kid that helped other sick kids.”Kyra Senese is a freelancer.

El obispo auxiliar y rector de la Universidad Católica de Santo Domingo, monseñor Jesús Castro Marte, consideró que muchos cristianos, incluido sacerdotes, no han entendido el mensaje de Jesús en la cruz y fruto de sus debilidades humanas lo han traicionado, pero que el papel de la Iglesia católica es recordarles que hay que volver a las raíces.Indicó que esta Semana Santa y siempre se mantiene el llamado constante de volver a Cristo, que fue humillado y maltratado. Criticó a los cristianos que solo buscan prestigio, poder y grandeza contraria a Jesucristo que rechazó todo eso y aunque padeció en la cruz tenía la certeza de que no se quedaría en el sufrimiento.“Hay miles de personas que son creyentes, que van constantemente al tempo, inclusive, consagrados sacerdotes que a veces traicionan su vocación sacerdotal. Por ejemplo, todo el problema que está sufriendo la Iglesia, y que le ha dolido fuertemente como el problema de la pedofilia, gente consagrada, gente que decía que creer en Jesucristo, pero han caído en esa enfermedad humana que ha escandalizado, ellos están negando el gran mensaje de salvación de Cristo, están traicionado el mansaje de Jesucristo que es amar al inocente, al ser humano”, sostuvo.Recordó que hoy existen muchos de los personajes de la época de Jesucristo, como Pedro que negó al maestro, sacerdote que van haciendo fraudes económicos en la iglesia...”cuanta vuelta ha dado el sentido de la banca de Roma cambiando gente, hay fragilidades humanas, pero no es el modelo ni el pensamiento de Dios es la parte humana la que falla. El también obispo auxiliar de la Arquidiócesis de Santo Domingo al participar en el Diálogo Libre, dijo que pese a ello la Iglesia, tal y como lo ha pedido el papa Francisco, sale de sí misma, de su entorno, para ir a la periferia, al encuentro con el hermano necesitado.“La iglesia dominicana siempre ha permanecido en la periferia, cuántas parroquias nosotros tenemos en lugares pobres, por ejemplo, todo el rio Ozama, Capotillo Isabela, Santo Domingo Norte y Monte Plata, hay una gran presencia de muchos sacerdotes y religiosas entregados por el evangelio, es un mandato de Jesucristo que lo dice claro: los pobres siempre estarán conmigo y la Iglesia nunca puede traicionar ese mensaje de Jesucristo de brindar a los pobres todo el apoyo humano y espiritual”.Precisó que, a través del proceso de llevar el evangelio a la periferia, la gente va acogiendo la palabra de Dios e insistió en que no se puede traicionar nunca el mensaje de Jesucristo a los más pobres, a los más marginados.Monseñor Castro Marte aseguró que hoy día las personas y los pueblos están crucificados porque existe sufrimiento, hambre, desnudez, rechazo, explotación y otras realidades de muerte que existen en el mundo que se traducen en la prolongación de muere de Cristo en la cruz.Sin embargo, precisó que por eso el cristiano conmemora siempre la cuaresma y la pascua porque nunca un cristiano se quedará en el sufrimiento porque ese grito llega hasta Dios.Afirmó que la Semana Santa es una vivencia, que no se puede ver como un recuerdo, que lo más importante es la vivencia espiritual que no debe quedarse en la cruz, en el pecado, en la confusión interna, porque Cristo ha resucitado y eso debe ser de plena alegría para todos los cristianos.“Hacemos un llamado especial al pueblo dominicano para que trate de vivir con profundidad estos días santos, pensando en que Cristo murió en la cruz, su padecimiento y sufrimiento no se quedó en la cruz, en el madero, sino que resucitó, así también debe ser nuestra vida, resucitar constantemente”, sostuvo.SANTO DOMINGO. Monseñor Castro Marte informó que en la Arquidiócesis de Santo Domingo están muy satisfechos con las vocaciones y reveló que en la actualidad unos 70 seminaristas se están formando para ser sacerdotes.Aclaró que, aunque el mundo ha cambiado, al igual que el aspecto religioso por las facilidades y la afluencia que tienen los jóvenes a través de los medios de dominación y los malos ejemplos de muchos religiosos, por encima de eso están surgiendo vocaciones.“Nosotros vocacionalmente en la arquidiócesis de Santo Domingo nos sentimos orgullos y satisfechos con las vocaciones”.“Nosotros vocacionalmente en la arquidiócesis de Santo Domingo nos sentimos orgullos y satisfechos con las vocaciones”. Destacó que se ha cambiado el sistema de la formación de los sacerdotes y puso de ejemplo que en Santiago el seminario Santo Tomas de Aquino, los seminaristas van durante el día a estudiar a la Universidad Católica Madre y Maestra y luego regresan al seminario donde reciben capacitación a parte de participar en actividades como misa, rosario, y otras.Sobre la vida del obispo que se retiran, dijo que ellos permanecen en una vida activa con retiros, orientaciones, van a seminarios y algunos hasta están encargados de parroquia y viven en paz en una residencia sacerdotal.“Nunca uno se retira, solo en la tumba. Ellos se retiran del concepto canónico, pero su vida sacerdotal está en constante actividad y la gente los va a visitar”, dijo.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

Los dominicanos que diariamente consumen los productos de la Pasteurizadora Rica y del Consorcio Cítricos Dominicanos tendrán la oportunidad de ser a la vez clientes y propietarios. No habrá, sin embargo, que ser consumidores para poder invertir en las acciones de esas compañías, a través de un mecanismo del mercado de valores de nuestro país.La propiedad de las acciones será indirecta, por vía de un fideicomiso creado con ese propósito. Los inversionistas personales e institucionales comprarán los títulos que el fideicomiso emita, y este último adquirirá las acciones con esos recursos, hasta un máximo del 40% del total de la propiedad accionaria de la compañía. El valor de la emisión será de hasta ocho mil millones de pesos y tendrá una vigencia de 30 años. Pero aunque los inversionistas no reciban certificados de acciones de la Rica expedidos individualmente a su nombre, serán, no obstante, dueños reales de una porción de las empresas, cuyo tamaño dependerá del monto que hayan invertido.Es indudable que la decisión de la Rica debió ser muy ponderada y debatida por sus ejecutivos y propietarios. Ser pioneros en cualquier actividad conlleva riesgos y genera interrogantes. En un entorno en el que la transparencia empresarial, por las razones que sea, no es un rasgo tan general, haber estado dispuestos a cumplir con todos los requisitos de información, supervisión y características de gobierno corporativo que la oferta pública de acciones involucra, muestra un encomiable sentido de apertura, así como una atinada visión del papel del mercado en el fortalecimiento y diversificación de las estructuras patrimoniales por los que nuestras compañías deberán transitar.Para los economistas es una buena noticia. Una de sus ocupaciones más interesantes es la de analizar y anticipar el desempeño de las empresas cuyas acciones pueden adquirirse. Hasta ahora, con los títulos de deuda en nuestro mercado, sus oportunidades han sido limitadas.Gustavo Volmar Lic. en Economía UASD. Doctor en Economía Columbia University.

Decenas de personas residentes en diferentes localidades del Cibao Central han acudido a Moca para deleitarse con la calle 26 de Julio que fue pintada en formatridimensional, la primera en su naturaleza en la República Dominicana.Directivos del patronato de la calle 26 de Julio y de la plazoleta en honor a los héroes que ajusticiaron al dictador Ulises Hereaux (Lilís) en esa vía en el 1899, ofrecieron detalles de la obra pictórica en declaraciones para Diario Libre.Juan Santiago Cabrera y José Danilito Rancier, del patronato explicaron que la calle 3D es parte de un proyecto completo que busca convertir esa vía completa con tramos donde se resalten el arte, la educación, tecnología, comunicaciones, bellas artes y la historia de la provincia."En este primer tramo, que comprende unos 60 metros, el profesor y artista del pincel Julio Tejada plasmó imágenes que se refieren a la demarcación geográfica de la ciudad, pero además donde sobresalen dos esferas con las famosas muñecas mocanas sin rostros y la otra con todos los municipios, museos y plazas de aquí", expresó Juan Santiago Cabrera.Indicó que para este año contemplan terminar dos tramos más de la calle y que para el 2020 se espera estén completados los demás.José Danilito Rancier declaró que esa obra fue posible gracias al respaldo de todos los legisladores de la provincia encabezados por el senador José Rafael Vargas, así como aportes de empresas, el Ayuntamiento y el Gobierno Central.El arquitecto de la obra fue Juan Alberto Tejada (Iki) dijo que es la primera obra que se logra en 3D en pavimento del país, y que el concepto general es destacar la historia, arte, cultura e incluso la gastronomía de la provincia.Mikenia Vargas, directora de la Casa 26 de Julio, ubicada en uno de los extremos de la vía y donde ajusticiaron al dictador Lilís, informó que la vía tridimensional es un gran logro para los mocanos y que servirá como atractivo tanto para los estudiantes como para los turistas nacionales e internacionales.La vía será peatonal en horas de la noche y días feriados.Julio Tejada, pintor desde niño y que trabaja como profesor en Bellas Artes, manifestó que por primera vez trabajó con el sistema de tres dimensiones lo que fue un gran reto para él."En este caso el lienzo fue el pavimento o concreto, en principio tuvimos algunos inconvenientes, pero finalmente lo logramos", subrayó Tejada.Dijo que la cascada tuvo que variarla varias veces.En esta obra colaboraron también los pintores Marcos Guzmán y Juan Camacho.En unos de los trazos puede observarse un avión de papel, pero también los edificios más importantes con lo que cuenta la ciudad.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

El Jazz de Utah intentó forzar a James Harden, que es zurdo, a ir hacia la derecha para complicarle el juego, en el primer partido de su serie de primera ronda de playoffs contra los Rockets de Houston.Sin embargo, a Harden no le importó mucho. Aun así lideró al equipo en puntos y ayudó a facilitar ataques de sus compañeros del cinco inicial en una clara victoria.Harden sumó 29 puntos y 10 asistencias para ayudar a Houston a ganar 122-90 en el primer partido de su serie.El cinco titular de los Rockets ayudó a mantener el marcador alto, con al menos 10 puntos cada uno. Eric Gordon anotó 17, Clint Capel 16, Chris Paul 14 y P.J. Tucker sumó 11.“Intentan algo con él y puede que consigan un poco, y él encuentra la forma de resolverlo y ya no le paran”, comentó Mike D’Antoni sobre la estrategia para defender contra Harden. “Es tan bueno en ataque que me hace reír. Es que es tan bueno que no sé que se puede hacer... no van a pararle. No importa lo que hagan”.Harden no se mostró sorprendido por la táctica utilizada.“He visto literalmente todas las defensas que pueden verse”, comentó. “De modo que era una cuestión de ajustarse y seguir comunicándome con los chicos sobre dónde debían estar”.Los Rockets tuvieron una ventaja de 10 puntos o más durante la mayor parte del encuentro, aunque el Jazz se puso a cinco minutos a mitad del tercer cuarto, hasta que Houston tuvo una gran racha para ampliar distancias.Es el segundo año consecutivo que los dos equipos se en encuentran en postemporada, después de que los Rockets eliminaran a Utah en cinco juegos en la segunda ronda del año pasado.El próximo partido es el miércoles en Houston.Houston ganaba de 15 en el último cuarto hasta que Harden anotó seis puntos en una racha de 9-2 que amplió la ventaja a 108-86 a cuatro minutos del final.Rudy Gobert anotó 22 puntos y 12 rebotes para liderar al Jazz tras no anotar más de 15 puntos en un juego en la serie de playoffs contra los Rockets la temporada pasada. Donovan Mitchell aportó 19 puntos, pero no hizo asistencias y el Jazz estuvo largos periodos sin anotar.Mitchell se mostró decepcionado con su proporción de asistencias y pérdidas de balón.“Ninguna asistencia. Cinco pérdidas de balón. Eso es enorme”, dijo. “No puedes tener ninguna asistencia y cinco pérdidas de balón”.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

El “Brexit” y el debate sobre la independencia de Escocia son inseparables desde 2016, según los expertos, que, en un momento arriesgado para los pronósticos políticos, coinciden en que tanto una salida abrupta de la Unión Europea (UE) como una negociada marcarán los pasos del secesionismo.En 2014, el 55 % de los escoceses rechazó la separación en un referéndum pactado con el Gobierno británico, tras el que se asumió que la cuestión quedaba zanjada para al menos una generación.Dos años más tarde, la victoria del “brexit” o salida de la UE (que contó con el voto en contra del 62 % de escoceses) puso patas arriba este argumento y prácticamente desde que se conocieron los resultados que dejarían al país fuera del bloque común, la ministra principal escocesa, Nicola Sturgeon, anunció su intención de volver a las urnas.Para los expertos, el hecho de abandonar la UE se consideró en 2014 como uno de los argumentos que hizo a los indecisos decantarse por mantenerse dentro del Reino Unido a riesgo de perder los beneficios del mercado común y la unión aduanera, que ahora desaparecerán si triunfa el acuerdo que busca el Gobierno británico.Con vistas al 31 de octubre próximo, la nueva fecha del “brexit”, Anthony Salamone, analista del Centro Escocés de Relaciones Europeas, y Aileen McHarg, profesora de Derecho de la Universidad Strathclyde de Glasgow, desgranan para Efe cómo los distintos escenarios de la ruptura pueden condicionar la hoja de ruta del independentismo.Los sondeos muestran que, desde la victoria del “brexit”, el respaldo a la independencia oscila entre el 43 % y el 47 %, una cifra similar al 45 % que la apoyó en la consulta de 2014.Salamone señaló que el Partido Nacionalista Escocés (SNP), que lidera Sturgeon, “no quería tener de nuevo el debate sobre un segundo referéndum de independencia hasta que las encuestas mostraran una mayoría clara”.“La única razón por la que lo están alimentando es porque el ‘brexit’ ha forzado el calendario”, indicó.Si finalmente el Reino Unido abandona la UE de forma negociada y además se mantiene en el mercado común y/o la unión aduanera, Salamone opina que la mayoría de escoceses “puede que se sienta más cómodo y no quiera separarse del Reino Unido”.Sin embargo, un escenario acordado que mitigue los efectos de la salida puede ocasionar, de acuerdo con McHarg, que los ciudadanos perciban “más fácilmente cuales son las cuestiones prácticas que se plantearían al romper con el Reino Unido” y que el temor a cambiar el sistema constitucional actual sea menor.Ambos analistas coinciden en que las encuestan pronostican que un escenario de este tipo hará aumentar significativamente el sentimiento independentista, ya que además las previsiones económicas prevén una caída del PIB en Escocia de hasta el 9 %.“Si no hay acuerdo, las encuestas sugieren que puede haber una mayoría en favor de la independencia. Si, por ejemplo, hay un acuerdo que termine con la libre circulación de personas, la opinión de muchos puede cambiar, porque Escocia, no solo está en favor de la libre circulación, sino que la necesita”, explicó Salamone.McHarg matizó, no obstante, que un “’brexit’ caótico” conduciría también a que parte de los ciudadanos “teman romper con una unión forjada durante tantos años”.Tras el receso parlamentario de Pascua, Sturgeon se ha comprometido a revelar cuáles son sus planes en relación a la posible convocatoria de una nueva consulta. Para volver a las urnas, es necesario que el Gobierno escocés reciba el permiso del británico y poder legislar así al respecto.McHarg y Salamone consideran que la ministra principal no cesará en su empeño de celebrar una segunda consulta (acuciada además por la presión de las bases y parte de los miembros del SNP que querrían una consulta lo antes posible), pero creen que el anuncio será vago en cuanto a los plazos.“Lo que creo es que Sturgeon no va a abandonar la idea de un segundo referéndum, la cuestión es si fijará un calendario específico o si será más general”, afirmó Salamone, que apuntó la posibilidad de que el SNP, primero en las encuestas, espere hasta después de las próximas elecciones regionales de 2021.La incertidumbre que arrastra inexorablemente el “brexit” es, para la profesora McHarg, la baza con la que juega la líder independentista, dado que “le evita tener que forzar esta cuestión, porque la última vez que lo hizo, en las elecciones generales de 2017, no le fue muy bien (el SNP perdió 21 escaños)”.“Hay un beneficio en la incertidumbre que genera el ‘brexit’, porque mantiene el debate independentista abierto, pero sin forzarlo a una conclusión que puede ser la que no quieren”, dijo.

Giannis Antetokounmpo corrió por la cancha e hizo clavada tras clavada hasta que los Pistons acabaron empujándole al suelo.El equipo con el mejor registro de la NBA quería demostrar que puede durar en los playoffs, y los Pistons de Detroit fueron incapaces de detenerlos.“No sé si estaban preparados para nosotros”, comentó después Antetokounmpo. “Pero intentamos centrarnos en nosotros mismos. Simplemente intentamos jugar con ritmo, correr a nuestros puestos e intentar hacer jugadas”.Antetokounmpo sumó 24 puntos y 17 rebotes en apenas 24 minutos, y los Bucks de Milwaukee ganaron 121-86 el domingo, en el primer juego de su serie en la primera ronda de la postemporada.Siete jugadores de los Bucks terminaron con dobles dígitos, y los anfitriones llegaron a abrir una ventaja de 43 puntos.Los Pistons solo lograron detener a Antetokounmpo cuando Andre Drummond le derribó de un empujón con ambas manos en el tercer cuarto, después de que el candidato al premio al Jugador Más Valioso atrapara un rebote ofensivo con Detroit 41 abajo.Drummond fue expulsado. Lanzó un beso al público del Fiserv Forum cuando salía del campo.Eric Bledsoe aportó 15 puntos, mientras que Brook Lopez y Khris Middleton añadieron 14 para los Bucks. George Hill anotó 16 puntos tras salir del banquillo.“Estábamos desorganizados en defensa y no conseguíamos hacer nada”, comentó el técnico de los Pistons, Dwane Casey. “Tenemos que llegar a otro nivel en intensidad y físico, porque ellos salen con equilibrio, ritmo al estilo europeo, con los codos y cosas así”.Luke Kennard lideró a los Pistons con 21 puntos como suplente y Drummond terminó con 12 puntos y 12 rebotes. Reggie Jackson también añadió 12 puntos. Detroit jugó sin Blake Griffin, que tiene una lesión en la rodilla izquierda.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

Una mujer blanca que promocionaba su restaurante en la ciudad de Nueva York por ofrecer una comida “limpia” de inspiración china se ha vuelto la restaurantera más reciente en ser acusada de abusar de los estereotipos gastronómicos y de la apropiación cultural.La propietaria del restaurante Lucky Lee’s también se burló de los platos chinos diciendo que nadan en “trozos de mantequilla procesada “, sodio y glutamato monosódico.Llovieron las críticas en línea contra el restaurante, alegando que su manera de promoverse se basó en prejuicios cansados y racistas de que la comida china es antihigiénica o grotesca.El caso del comedor, que se inauguró días atrás en Greenwich Village, reavivó el debate en Estados Unidos sobre cómo los chefs deben manejar la gastronomía de una cultura que no es la suya.Arielle Haspel, que es blanca y una instructora certificada de salud, dijo al sitio web de restaurantes Eater que ella quería ofrecer versiones modificadas y “limpias” de los platos típicos chinos. En un mensaje en Instagram, Haspel dijo que un plato de fideos chinos, lo mein, puede hacer que la gente se sienta “inflada y apestosa”.Los críticos en línea se abalanzaron contra Haspel, entre ellos el escritor neoyorquino Eddie Huang, quien descalificó la comida de Lucky Lee’s como “el Fyre Fest de la comida y el ‘bienestar’”, en la página del restaurante en Instagram.Fyre Fest alude al fallido Festival Fyre, que supuestamente iba a ofrecer alimentos, música y hospedaje de lujo en el segundo trimestre de 2017 en una isla bahameña. En lugar de villas lujosas y comidas gourmet, los asistentes al festival recibieron sándwiches preempacados y tiendas de campaña como alojamiento.Haspel se disculpó posteriormente, pero sus comentarios constituyen el error más reciente de varios restauranteros y chefs de televisión que han sido criticados por su insensibilidad al lidiar con la comida de una cultura que no es la suya propia.Robert Ku, profesor de estudios asiático-estadounidenses en la Universidad de Binghampton, Nueva York, dijo que Haspel parecía repetir los viejos estereotipos sobre la falta de higiene o lo grotesco de la cocina china. Fue una falta de consideración particular en Nueva York, donde muchos consumen comida china de manera habitual.“Son metáforas gastadas que se han adherido a la cocina china más que a cualquier otra”, dijo Ku, autor de trabajos sobre la política cultural de la cocina asiática en Estados Unidos. “Su enfoque es el de la salud y la higiene, lo cual implica que los otros no lo son”.Añadió que es un mito que los restaurantes chinos en Estados Unidos usen glutamato monosódico. La mayoría lo eliminaron de sus cocinas en la década de 1970.Haspel ofreció disculpas en una entrevista el viernes con el New York Times. Previamente había reconocido la indignación a través de Instagram y prometido escuchar y reflexionar sobre la reacción de la gente. No respondió a los pedidos de declaraciones de la AP.También han sido fustigados chefs blancos como Andrew Zimmern y Gordon Ramsay por sus respectivos restaurantes asiáticos, que incluyen en sus nombres el adjetivo “lucky” (afortunado). Esa palabra es un estereotipo en los restaurantes de comida asiática en países angloparlantes.Zimmern dijo en una entrevista el año pasado que su restaurante Lucky Cricket en Minnesota salvaba las almas de la gente que come en “restaurantes (grosería) que se hacen pasar por cocina china” en la región. Posteriormente ofreció disculpas.El británico Ramsay inaugurará su restaurante Lucky Cat, de inspiración japonesa, en Londres a mediados de año. Dijo en un comunicado de prensa en febrero que su restaurante sería “revolucionario” y “auténtico”, pero muchos advirtieron la ausencia de asiáticos en los puestos ejecutivos clave de la empresa.Por el otro lado, algunos chefs han ganado fama de visionarios por la mezcla de cocinas. Roy Choi elevó la categoría de los puestos callejeros con su Kogi BBQ en Los Ángeles en 2008. Choi combinó sus raíces coreanas con las tortillas para crear bocadillos deliciosos como tacos de costillas a la coreana.Oponerse a la apropiación cultural no significa necesariamente a que alguien cocine por fuera de su propio grupo étnico o cultural, dijo el profesor Ku, pero el límite suele ser borroso entre apropiación y apreciación.“La gente reacciona contra el concepto de que ‘durante generaciones, los chinos en Estados Unidos hicieron cosas, pero horriblemente mal. Como persona blanca, yo puedo hacerlo mejor’”, dijo Ku.El restaurantero neoyorquino Stratis Morfogen, de ascendencia griega, no se preocupa por las acusaciones de apropiación cultural contra su casa de asados por sus productos de inspiración china.Brooklyn Chop House, que abrió sus puertas el otoño pasado, ofrece hamburguesas con queso, pastrami y sopa de cebolla francesa con albóndigas chinas. Morfogen está colaborando con la cantante Patti LaBelle para llevar ese último guiso a los pasillos de alimentos congelados de los supermercados, envasado en vaporizadores de bambú reutilizables.“Si la gente no avanzara, no innovara o no creara y fusionara diferentes culturas, el paisaje culinario sería bastante aburrido”, comentó Morfogen.Morfogen da empleo a más de 15 chefs chinos en sus restaurantes y uno de sus socios es un chef chino. Cree que los dueños de restaurantes preocupados por caer en estereotipos de manera inadvertida sólo tienen que pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar.“Realmente creo que esas palabras son insensibles y lastiman a la gente”, apuntó Morfogen. “No creo que eso sea lo que la comida debe ser. Creo que la comida es para unir a todas las culturas y respetarse mutuamente”.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

Samantha Cerio, la gimnasta de la Universidad de Auburn que se rompió las dos piernas durante una competición de la NCAA , ha anunciado que se retira de la gimnasia.”Ha sido mi última noche como gimnasta. No podría estar más orgullosa de la persona que la gimnasia me ha hecho ser. Me enseñó trabajo duro, humildad, integridad y dedicación”, anunció Samantha Cerio, que se dislocó las dos rodillas, sufrió fracturas de tibia y peroné en ambas piernas y se le rompieron varios ligamentos.“Puede que mi carrera no haya terminado como tenía planeado... pero nada sale como una planea”, explicó la ya ex gimnasta de 22 años, que tuvo que pasar por el quirófano, en su cuenta de Instagram.Cerio, habló hoy sobre el desgarrador momento en que sufrió lesiones que terminaron con su carrera en ambas rodillas en una competencia a principios de este mes.“Cuando terminé esa, sentí que algo andaba mal, y pensé que me había hiperextendido las rodillas hasta que miré hacia abajo y ese no fue el caso”, dijo en una entrevista exclusiva el lunes.“Cuando vi lo que sucedió, fue cuando el dolor comenzó a empeorar y empeoró. Fue un gran ‘Oh, dispara, ¿qué acaba de pasar?’ ‘’Cerio obtuvo una gran cantidad de apoyo de todo el país por su actitud positiva después de que se dislocó ambas rodillas y rompió múltiples ligamentos después de un aterrizaje incómodo durante una rutina en el piso en los Regionales NCAA en Baton Rouge, Louisiana, el 5 de abril.El video del momento de giro del estómago se volvió viral. Cerio golpeó a las personas que lo compartieron en un tweet durante el fin de semana, y escribió que su dolor “no era su entretenimiento”.“Creo que ha hecho que la gente sea más consciente de lo que ven en Internet. Cuando ves algo así, quieres verlo solo para ver qué pasa porque tienes curiosidad, pero al mismo tiempo, no piensas en la gente que podría impactar “.Cerio ahora está trabajando a través de la lesión para continuar un futuro brillante. Fue nombrada como la mejor atleta del año de la Southeastern Conference y ya ha aceptado un trabajo en Seattle con Boeing trabajando en cohetes como ingeniera de análisis de diseño estructural. @sam_cerio is having a great day!

For ages people have said that the simple act of smiling can boost one's mood – and alternatively, that frowning can make one feel down – but psychologists have long disagreed about whether facial expressions can lead to the emotions related to those expressions.Now a team of researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Texas A&M have co-authored a paper taking a deeper look at the question. In their research, they looked at nearly 50 years of data testing and found that, yes, smiling really can make people feel happier. A little bit, at least.In their meta-analysis, Coles and his team looked at data from 138 studies including more than 11,000 participants from across the globe."Some studies have not found evidence that facial expressions can influence emotional feelings," Coles said. "But we can't focus on the results of any one study. Psychologists have been testing this idea since the early 1970s, so we wanted to look at all the evidence."After crunching the numbers, they concluded that facial expressions do indeed have an impact on feelings. And it's not just smiling and happiness, they found that scowling makes people feel angrier and frowning makes them feel sadder.Alas, the impact doesn't appear to be dramatic. As described in the paper, "the overall effect of facial feedback was significant but small.""We don't think that people can smile their way to happiness," Coles said. "But these findings are exciting because they provide a clue about how the mind and the body interact to shape our conscious experience of emotion. We still have a lot to learn about these facial feedback effects, but this meta-analysis put us a little closer to understanding how emotions work."But hey, as far as I'm concerned, any little push towards happiness could come in handy. As Thich Nhat Hanh has said, “Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.”The study, "A Meta-Analysis of the Facial Feedback Literature: Effects of Facial Feedback on Emotional Experience Are Small and Variable," was published in Psychological Bulletin.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.Two weeks of climate action are starting on April 15.You wouldn't know it in North America, but it's a big day for climate protests. It's the start of two weeks of direct action by Extinction Rebellion. "This is not a one-off march – we will keep going for as long as we have to, shutting down cities day after day until our demands are met," the most significant being CARBON NET ZERO BY 2025 – The Government must enact legally-binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and take further action to remove the excess of atmospheric greenhouse gases.Waterloo bridge transformed!

And yet, should it fail, the long-term costs of climate change will be immense for almost everybody now alive and for all our descendants, too.They’ve got music, trees, a skate ramp and free vegetarian food here on Waterloo Bridge - while police watch and traffic snarls up. There’s no telling how long @ExtinctionR plan to block the bridge for, or other central London locations like Oxford Circus @LBC pic.twitter.com/VyG08IYfvOThey are not wrong to focus on cars; the convenience of drivers and the price of gasoline seems to be a powerful political force. "The gilets jaunes movement in France started off in part as a protest against price rises on petrol; the Blair government sustained its first big defeat at the hands of lorry drivers in the fuel protests of 2000, which destroyed a sensible and ecologically necessary plan to raise fuel taxes steadily over time to discourage the use of fossil fuels." Doug Ford got elected in Ontario, Canada by promising lower fuel prices. But unfortunately, "a future of less consumption and less convenience is inevitable."Today April 15thSwedish Parliament right now#Swedish @ExtinctionR #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/nMDTVG0tleThe protests are intended as the start of a global movement, as they must be.

Do you want it? pic.twitter.com/vxdNmrky1IGeorge Monbiot is even more radical, writing that Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse, and suggesting that our whole economic system must change. (Listen to him in the tweet, and watch everyone's jaws drop.)Our system – characterised by perpetual economic growth on a planet that is not growing – will inevitably implode. The only question is whether the transformation is planned or unplanned. Our task is to ensure it is planned, and fast. We need to conceive and build a new system based on the principle that every generation, everywhere has an equal right to enjoy natural wealth.He's a fan of the Extinction Rebellion, concluding: "The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun.""The activists, known as Extinction Rebellion, occupied the House of Assembly for around an hour, telling stories of their grandchildren and the lives they believe will face them as a product of what they call a "climate catastrophe"." https://t.co/MxnmHpyW9L @ExtinctionRIt is so different in North America, where The New York Times devotes an entire magazine section to climate and cannot even get the very first sentence right:The world’s most difficult problem has a solution so simple that it can be expressed in four words: Stop burning greenhouse gases.Because they are either technically illiterate or they are simply afraid to say "stop burning fossil fuels." Then the most extreme statement they come up with is:The most fundamental question is whether a capitalistic society is capable of sharply reducing carbon emissions. Will a radical realignment of our economy require a radical realignment of our political system — within the next few years? Even if the answer is no, we have some decisions to make. How, for instance, should the proceeds of a carbon tax be directed? Should they be used to finance clean energy projects, be paid out directly to taxpayers or accrue to the national budget? In a healthy democracy, you could expect a rigorous public debate on this question.Today Denmark joins #ExtinctionRebellion in #InternationalRebellion.

It belongs to Ellen Bennett, a former professional chef and now kitchen-wear entrepreneur, who lives in Echo Park, Los Angeles.Bennett offers several great tips for organizing your home kitchen like a professional. These are tried-and-true methods for easier food storage, preparation, and serving that also make for a more attractive space.While you can read the entire tour in detail here, I took away the following points:Bennett has divided her kitchen tools into 4 categories: prep, cook, serve, store. All containers are stashed in drawers and cupboards according to their categorization.The same idea applies to flavors. Her fridge is divided into sections for Asian sauces, American sauces, pickled items, fruits and vegetable, and cheese.On the countertop, she keeps what she calls her “flavor station,” a reliable wooden bowl stocked with shallots, garlic and red onions. “They’re the raw materials,” she says, “the all-around the basics of good flavor.Come up with a simple system for labeling and stick with it. All you need is a roll of masking tape and a marker, or if you want to get fancy, chalkboard pen on black sticker labels. Label and date all refrigerator items, spice containers, frozen foods, pantry baskets. There will be less waste, as you won't have mysteriously unidentifiable foods kicking around.For those items that you use multiple times a day, keep them out on the counter and make them easily accessible. Get a magnetic knife strip. Have a basket near the stove with olive oil, salt, pepper, and butter. Leave a cutting board on the counter, a compost bin handy.It can be tempting to acquire specialized gadgets, but unless you use them on a regular basis, they're just taking up valuable real estate and contributing to a general sense of clutter.Counting a chef’s knife, a paring knife, a bread knife and a pair of scissors as kitchen drawer essentials, [Bennett is] a staunch opponent of single-utility items like cherry pitters and garlic presses. “Do not get an avocado slicer,” she says. “Learn to use a knife.”Treat your pantry like your closet. It needs a major declutter and overhaul on a regular basis. Bennett recommends tossing (or donating) anything you haven't used within six months and keeping only those things that reflect your current cooking habits.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.Hubble's image of Messier 3 reveals what astronomers say is one of the prettiest "globular clusters" in the universe.In 1758, the chief astronomer of the Marine Observatory in Paris, Charles Messier, was observing a comet when he became distracted by a cloudy something in the constellation Taurus. Messier made a note of the object to help other comet hunters avoid becoming distracted by it. Commonly known today as M1 (Messier 1) or the Crab Nebula, it became the first object in Messier’s Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters, a listing of comet-like "objects to avoid."By the time of his death in 1817, Messier's list included 103 diffuse objects in the night sky that could be mistaken for comets. The catalog contains galaxies, planetary and other types of nebulae, and star clusters. Fast-forward two centuries and astronomers are working to make images of the catalog's objects with the help of the Hubble telescope. Why? Because as NASA notes, "the Messier catalog includes some of the most fascinating astronomical objects that can be observed from Earth’s Northern Hemisphere."The third such object on the list, Messier 3, is a globular cluster – as can be seen in the Hubble image above. The European Space Agency (ESA) notes:Globular clusters are inherently beautiful objects, but the subject of this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, Messier 3, is commonly acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful of them all.At 8 billion years old, this "cosmic bauble" includes an astonishing half-million stars, making it one of the largest and brightest globular clusters ever discovered."However, what makes Messier 3 extra special is its unusually large population of variable stars," writes ESA, "stars that fluctuate in brightness over time. New variable stars continue to be discovered in this sparkling stellar nest to this day, but so far we know of 274, the highest number found in any globular cluster by far."Aside from the abundance of variable stars, Messier 3 also plays home to a relatively high number of "blue stragglers," which can be seen in the image. "These are blue main sequence stars that appear to be young because they are bluer and more luminous than other stars in the cluster," notes ESA.While it took Hubble to reveal the details of this virtual storm of gemstones, many of the other objects in the Messier catalog are bright enough to be seen through a small telescope, making the catalog's illustrious items popular targets for amateur astronomers of all levels. What Mother Nature provides on our home planet is magical enough; that we can look to the heavens and see such wonders is the icing on the cake ... as well as a great reminder not to lose the nighttime sky.You can see Hubble's images of other objects listed by Messier here.Aaron Beard, Ap Sports WriterRALEIGH, N.C. (AP) — A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDaily and Weekly newsletters available.Their new (re)new system uses less plastic, but it is a bit deceptive.There are a number of issues with bottled water, but the biggest one is probably the bottle, the amount of solid fossil fuel wrapped around the water. Now Evian, the French water company, is introducing (re)new, a 5-liter bubble full of water made of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which sits on a sort of countertop water cooler.Fast Company's Adele Peters picks up on the plastic savings:However, there is an asterisk after that statement pointing to small print on the press release that says, "*Compared, per litre of water, to a 1.5L evian® bottle (3.33 x 1.5L evian® bottles)." So it really means that the bubble uses 66 percent of the plastic that would be in 3.3 conventional bottles. Since every bottle contains more water in relation to its surface area as it gets bigger, this sounds a lot less impressive than at first glance.Then there is the electronics built into the base, which connects to an app on your phone and orders a new bubble of water when a refill is needed. So modern!The introduction of this sleek in-home natural mineral water appliance is the latest move from evian® in its journey to become a circular brand by 2025 and will build on the brand's ambition to be carbon neutral by 2020.Now we love the circular economy here at TreeHugger, the idea that nothing goes to the dump and plastic all gets recycled; and we acknowledge that some people do have a need for bottled water (although they don't in London or Paris where the Evian bubble is being launched), so we won't even talk about the question of bottle vs tap. I drink bottled water all summer when I am away from a municipal water supply.But there has been a pretty much universal standard of 5 gallon or 18.9 litre refillable jugs for decades. That's almost 4 Evian bubbles and it is circular without having to recycle and remanufacture a PET bubble. It's solid and hard to puncture, whereas the Evian bubble has to be shipped in a cardboard box, no doubt made from recycled cardboard. I drag my jugs to the store and refill them there from a tested source, and have been using the same ones for a decade; now that's circular.I hate to puncture the Evian bubble, but the phrase "circular economy" is being used more and more to justify "business as usual" – we will keep packaging things in plastic, but will try to use a bit less and try to harder to recycle it. That's just not good enough anymore.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.It's proof that documentaries are powerful tools for change.When the BBC aired Blue Planet II in 2017, people were outraged about ocean plastic pollution like never before. It was suddenly a hot topic, being cited by everyone everywhere. People who had never done it before started taking reusable bags to the grocery store and refusing plastic packaging.But would the enthusiasm last? You know how it goes... the initial determination to live better wanes over time and habits return to their default state. Only time would tell.Researchers questioned 3,833 consumers in the United Kingdom and United States and found that more than half have reduced the amount of single-use plastic they are using in the last year. Forty-two percent of people consider sustainable materials to be important when making day-to-day purchases and tend to trust brands more if they make statements about sustainability. Motivations cited include concern for the future of the environment and wanting to reduce one's personal waste footprint.There was a significant difference between younger and older people's views. Older people (55-64) think it's more important for something to be affordable, whereas younger people (16 to 24) value sustainability more. Chase Buckle, trends manager at Global Web Index, explained,"It may come as a shock to some that the younger consumers are more considerate about sustainable materials than older generations. What is important to note, is that the younger generations grew up during the height of the sustainability crisis with high-profile, environmentalist documentaries widely available on the content platforms they prefer over conventional TV."This is hopeful news for times like these, as young people will grow up to become the decision-makers of the future. The more they care about the environment and reject plastics, the more those views will be reflected in policies going forward.Ken Powtak, Associated PressCaptionCloseBOSTON (AP) — Chris Davis knows his homer went a lot further than teammate Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-run shot. He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot — estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's — projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name — 'Crush' — for a reason."Renato Núñez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vázquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velázquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vázquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vázquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports BREAKING NEWS  PROGRAM ALERT WEATHER ALERT WeatherThreat.com ClosingsWest Lafayette, Ind. – Behind a season-high 14 hits, the Nebraska softball team (15-24, 4-8 Big Ten) won its second game of the day against Purdue on Saturday by a score of 9-4.

Daily and Weekly newsletters available.£1 million in grants will be divided among groups wanting to improve recycling facilities. But why should people have to compete for help in dealing with Starbucks' own trash?It has been just over a year since Starbucks introduced its 5p 'latte levy' on disposable cups. The minuscule fine is meant to discourage customers from choosing a disposable cup and encourage them to bring their own, a further incentive being the 25p discount they receive if they bring a reusable cup.The collected money goes into a Cup Fund held by Hubbub, an environmental charity that has outlined several different initiatives aimed at reducing single-use plastic use and pollution. Last summer Sami wrote about one of these latte levy-funded initiatives – taking children out on the Thames River to 'fish' for plastic. The initiative will increase the number of drop-off points for cup collection, which is something that people often struggle to find when they reach the end of their daily journeys, and provide clearer communication to customers about how to recycle effectively.In the words of Trewin Restorick, CEO of Hubbub,"We know that local authorities and building managers are committed to achieving their recycling targets but with increased strain on their budgets, investing in infrastructure is difficult. The launch of the Cup Fund means we will be able to collect cups in significant volumes in areas where there may not have been any drop-off points before."This is all well and good, but why is there no criticism of the consumption model? Much of this waste problem could be alleviated immediately if (a) disposable cups were exorbitantly expensive, upwards of £2-3 apiece, or (b) they were banned outright for being unsustainable and archaic. People adapt quickly. Avid coffee-drinkers will start carrying reusable cups, just like they do car keys and phones. It becomes a habit in no time.And doesn't it seem ridiculous that community groups have to compete for professional help with dealing with Starbucks' own trash? This is yet another example of Big Companies offloading responsibility for dealing with their own unsustainable and non-circular business models onto individual citizens. Starbucks should be held responsible for dealing with every single one of its cups, without anyone having to enter a competition to be deemed worthy of aid.In the meantime, I suppose it's progress of a sort that people are concerned about where their disposables end up. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture and how celebrating coffee cup recycling is a lot like bragging about good mileage on one's private plane (as a commenter once described it). If you really want to feel good about your coffee habits, bring your own or use an in-store ceramic mug. There's no other way around it.

ASCENSION PARISH - Officials say a 19-year-old man pled guilty to indecent behavior with a juvenile and second-degree battery.On December 1, 2017 detectives with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office were contacted in reference to a sex crime complaint. During the investigation, authorities learned Tyler Johnson inappropriately touched a juvenile female.Johnson was arrested and booked into the Ascension Parish Detention Center. While in jail, Johnson got into a fight with another inmate on October 29, 2018. Authorities say Johnson punched an inmate in the face, which resulted in the inmate hitting his head on the floor. The inmate suffered a laceration to the back of his head. Johnson was charged with second-degree battery for the fight. For the indecent behavior with a juvenile charge, Johnson was sentenced to 25 years in jail with credit for time served.  It was ordered that Johnson to serve 12 years of that sentence and the remaining 13 are to be suspended. After being released, he will be placed on five years supervised probation and he must register as a sex offender.For the fight at the jail, Johnston was sentenced to three years in jail with credit for time served.A massive fire broke out April 15, 2019, at Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the most visited landmarks in the world. Police said the fire is possibly linked to a renovation project that was underway at the church's spire. For good reason, onlookers wept Monday as they watched the gut-wrenching sight of flames engulfing Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and toppling its delicate Gothic spire and wood roof.The cathedral, with its muscular bell towers, graceful flying buttresses and delicate rose windows, is a magnificent synthesis of engineering, architecture and art — a monument left by medieval builders that still dazzles the modern world.For Catholics, many of whom who regard Notre Dame as a monument to religious devotion as well as an architectural masterpiece, the timing of the blaze, during the week leading to Easter, made it all the more searing.French President Emmanuel Macron crystallized the thoughts of millions Monday when he tweeted that the blaze was like "a part of us being on fire."With Paris fire officials saying late Monday that they had prevented the fire from destroying Notre Dame’s main structure, the grim task ahead will be to determine the fire’s cause, assess the robustness of the structural elements that survive, and, if possible, map a route for rebuilding the edifice, more than 850 years old.If, as Paris fire officials suspect, the fire was caused by a $6.8 million renovation project on the church's spire, the conflagration would recall the 2006 fire that destroyed all but the exterior walls of Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adler’s Pilgrim Baptist Church on Chicago’s South Side. That blaze broke out during roof repairs.“You assume that people are taking the proper precautions if they’re using open flames,” said Gunny Harboe, a Chicago architect who specializes in historic preservation. “But clearly mistakes sometimes get made.”Sometimes, he explained, contractors need to apply a flame directly to a surface to make repairs.The cathedrals of medieval France, built in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, have “beautiful but fragile roof systems that are made out of wood,” said Harboe, who has visited Notre Dame several times. “When the roof is centuries old, it’s just tinder. It doesn’t take much to get it going.”The first stone at Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The cathedral wasn’t finished until 1345.The world watched in horror Monday as a fire engulfed one of its most beloved landmarks. As the blaze gutted Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, some Chicago-area residents in France witnessed the ruin.They described a fire that not only damaged the physical structure but wounded the heart of the city...Along the way, Notre Dame’s builders experimented with structural innovations — pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttress (an arched exterior support) — that allowed them to reach once-unthinkable heights and transform exterior walls into diaphanous expanses of stained glass.In some ways, their rational approach anticipated the innovations that Chicago architects and engineers would use centuries later in designing the first skyscrapers in the 1880s.But unlike even greater realizations of the Gothic ideal at later cathedrals, the one in Paris is distinguished by its location in the center of the city, on an island in the Seine River. That embeds it in daily life, and in the public mind.“Because it’s urban and it’s right in this tremendous confluence of governmental buildings, cultural buildings and university buildings, it’s more important by virtue of its contact with all these different things,” said Alison Fisher, an associate curator of architecture and design at the Art Institute of Chicago.Indeed, the cathedral has come to represent French survival, having outlasted the Hundred Years’ War, the French Revolution and two world wars. By virtue of its age, scale and layers of history, it has no precise equivalent in Chicago. The castle-like Water Tower that survived the Great Fire of 1871 is a bauble by comparison.The cathedral took on added cultural relevance when it was immortalized in Victor Hugo’s 1831 novel, “The Hunchback of Notre Dame,” the tale of the bell ringer Quasimodo.Looking ahead, experts on medieval architecture said Monday, a key question is whether the stone vaults over the cathedral’s nave and crossing survived.“The best case is that the stone exterior walls and vaults remain,” said John Stamper, associate dean and professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame. “They’ll have to restore those vaults. There will be burn damage on them. … That’s better than having to rebuild the stonework. They’ll rebuild the roof and they’ll have to rebuild the spire over the crossing.”The worst case, Stamper added, is if the burning timber roof structure fell onto the vaults and caused them to collapse.The cathedral of Notre Dame has been damaged before, though never to this extent.During the French Revolution, the kingly statues lining the facade were beheaded. In the mid-19th century, the cathedral was restored by the French architect and author Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.In 2012, as the cathedral prepared to celebrated its 850th anniversary, a renovation added new lighting, built a platform to view the Gothic facade, renovated the organ and provided new bells.Last year, the Catholic Church in France made an urgent appeal for funds to restore the cathedral.Now, a much greater sum will be needed to restore one of France’s, and the world’s, great landmarks.Blair Kamin is a Tribune critic. bkamin@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BlairKaminBy Katelyn Caralle, U.s.

Trump tweeted.Trump also tweeted congratulations to the golfing legend over the weekend.  This is Woods' fifth green jacket, and his win on Sunday is already being lauded as one of the greatest sports comebacks of all time.President Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods because of his success and comeback in sports and lifeWoods earned his fifth green jacket Sunday after it seemed his career was over following several physical obstacles and person issues The Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States that recognizes 'an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors'It was established in 1945 to honor civilian service during World War II.Other sports icons who have received the award include Michael Jordan, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Yogi Berra, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the past few years, it seemed as though Woods' career was over as he faced a series of personal problems and chronic back pain. He had a spinal fusion surgery in 2017.That same year, he faced charges for driving under the influence.Woods' personal life, and career, had already been on the decline before the back surgery and DUI charge when years before his ongoing cheating was brought to light.  Woods won the Gene Serazen Cup in 2013 at the Cadillac Championship golf tournament at Trump National Dural in Florida. Trump is an avid golfer and often spends his free time on the courseWoods' last Masters win before Sunday was in 2005, 14 years agoWoods met his now-former wife Elin Nordegren in 2001, and they had two children.In 2009 the chronic cheating went public when the National Enquirer published a story outlining his relationship with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub hostess.  Woods also had a relationship with cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs. Other than his two mistresses, Woods also reportedly had unprotected sex with porn starts. Following the scandals Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors of Woods lost billions of dollars collectively, and some dropped him completely. At the time, Woods released a statement saying he was 'taking an indefinite leave from golf to work on saving his marriage,' and wanted to focus 'on being a better husband, father, and person.' Woods had a few good seasons upon returning to golf after news of the affairs simmered, but never had another big win until this weekend. Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBATON ROUGE - The Louisiana Legislative Auditor's Office said three Zachary government employees used city fuel cards for personal use, according to a recent audit.In July 2018, officials discovered the employees were using the cards inappropriately. The estimated amount of funds misappropriated was approximately $9,800.Two employees were suspended without pay for 35 days, put on six months probation, and had to pay back $1,300. Officials say the third employee was arrested. According to the audit, the employee resigned and agreed to forfeit vacation and sick pay. Policies were in place that would have prevented the fraud noted in this finding, but those policies were not followed as required.

Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.  Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe. Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women. Cook, who born in 1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found. She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985. Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine. Prudhomme, who was born in 1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed. The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered. Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine. Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved. Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.  Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 15:43 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:24 EDT, 15 April 2019   724View  commentsThe world stood helpless as Notre Dame burned on Monday and hundreds of French fire fighters worked to put out the blaze. As they battled the flames, world leaders and celebrities took to social media in shock to share their sadness and disbelief. They likened the gut-wrenching images and videos of the cathedral's crumbling spire to like watching 'someone you love die'. United in their sadness, here are some of their reactions.Fire fighters continue to battle the flames at the Notre Dame in Paris, hours after a fire broke out   Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
