Robinson is as revered an athlete as you will find in any sport and has become a symbol for how a single person can change a powerful institution for the better. While Robinson himself has survived the magnifying glass of history the way few individuals can, his legacy is still susceptible to reexaminationspecifically, it is worth examining what integration truly means.As important as Robinsons debut was, it certainly did not signal that any racial reconciliation or equality had been achieved. Robinson was but one player in a league otherwise full of white men, and his presence did not result in an integrated Major League Baseball in 1947. Instead, integration happened in a long, slow march over the course of more than a generation, with many individuals playing their own barrier-breaking roles. It would take a dozen years after Robinsons debut before the Boston Red Sox became the final team to sign its first black player, inking Pumpsie Green in 1959. Jackie didnt live to see Frank Robinson become the first black manager  in 1975.AdvertisementOne of the defining features of baseballs early steps toward integration was the standard of exceptionalism that the first black players were held to. Jackie was an immediate superstar. He won the inaugural Rookie of the Year award, and his 1949 MVP season remains one of the finest ever by a second baseman.  Had he played a full career in MLB (he entered at age 28), his cumulative numbers would place him among the all-time greats. Many other early black players followed his success: Larry Doby, the second black player in the Majors, hit over .300 in his second season, and went on to make seven All-Star teams; Roy Campanella became Robinsons teammate in 1948 and was named an All-Star in each of his first eight full seasons; every year from 1949 to 1953, a black player was crowned the NLss Rookie of the Year, including Willie Mays in 1951.But not every early black player immediately produced at an elite level, and baseball had no place for those who did not. Willard Brown, who is enshrined in the National Baseball Hall of Fame for his contributions in the Negro leagues, was given only 67 at-bats to prove himself in 1947 with the St. Louis Browns. Failing to do so, he was unceremoniously cut. Brown went on to lead the Negro American League in home runs and won two triple crowns in the Puerto Rican Winter League, yet he was never given a second chance in MLB.  Similarly, pitcher Dan Bankhead was given a mere four-game audition with the Dodgers in 1947, and he did not pitch well.  He was then relegated to the minors, where he remained for the next two seasons despite winning 20 games each year.These players stories paint a more nuanced picture of the barrier itself: it was Robinsons immense talent (and good fortune at having that talent manifest immediately) at least as much as any actual racial tolerance that led to baseballs integration. This should be obvious and is something that Robinson himself understood. As Leo Durocher purportedly told Dodgers players who were skeptical of Robinson, he can make us all rich.AdvertisementOne definition of integration would be the point at which black players no longer had to be exceptional to survive; when players whose performance was close to that of an average (white) player were allowed to remain in the big leagues; when MLB finally had black journeymen. This would be a more accurate picture of a player whose presence truly represented a broader racial inclusion, rather than exceptional talent alone.The list of the first black Major League players is littered with  Hall of Famers like Jackie Robinson, Larry Doby, Roy Campanella, Willie Mays, Satchel Paige, and Monte Irvin, and stars like Minnie Mioso (a nine-time All-Star) and Don Newcombe (one of only two players in history to win an MVP, a Cy Young, and a Rookie of the Year award), alongside washouts who were given only the shortest chance to succeed. It was not until the mid-1950s that the first players emerge who fit into neither category.  Two players in particular, Harry Simpson and Bob Boyd, accomplished the outstanding feat of having relatively long careers (880 and 696 games, respectively) despite being black and, statistically, only average ballplayers.  These two men had different career paths, but both displayed resilience and achieved their own type of remarkable success that deserves to be celebrated alongside other pioneers like Robinson.AdvertisementIn 1949, a scout labeled a young outfielder and first baseman named Harry Suitcase Simpsonthen with the Philadelphia Stars of the Negro National Leaguethe tan Ted Williams. Lean and nimble, with a smooth swing, Simpson had up-and-down success in the Negro leagues but impressed enough to be offered a tryout for MLB teams. On April 21, 1951, the fourth game of the 1951 season, the 25-year-old Simpson made his major-league debut for the Cleveland Indians, entering as a pinch-hitter in the bottom of the eighth, making him the 16th black player in Major League Baseball. This would begin an eight-year, five-team, almost 900-game career in which Harry Simpson achieved the incredible: he built a career as a black man in Major League Baseball despite almost never being better than a serviceable starter.Far from the 67 at-bats that Willard Brown received, Simpson was given more than 1,000 at-bats with the Indians over the course of the 1951, 52, and 53 seasons.  He failed to live up to his scout-bestowed nickname, however, batting a very un-Williams-like .246.  As a result, he spent the entire 1954 season in the minors.  But Simpson persevered, thanks in part to the expanding role for black players in the Major Leagues.  Where only five of baseballs 16 teams had fielded a black player before the 1953 season, that number had risen to 12 by the beginning of 1955.  Simpson was traded to one of those teamsthe Kansas City Athleticswhere he stuck as a starter.  Modern statistics rate Simpsons performance with the Athletics as decidedly below average, and he never recorded more than one Win Above Replacement in any season with them.  But he did lead the league in triples twice, and even played in one All-Star game.  Simpson was given further opportunities with the Yankees, White Sox, and Pirates before his career petered out at the age of 34.  Near the end of his career, a newspaper article stated what would have been unimaginable for a black player only a few years prior: No player ever received more consideration, or a longer and seemingly endless trial, than Simpson did.       AdvertisementOn Sept 8, 1951, Bob Boyd debuted for the Chicago White Sox.  Unlike the prospect Simpson, Boyd was a 31-year old veteran of the Negro leagues, where he became known as a line-drive hitting first baseman. Boyd was the first black player to sign a contract with the Chicago White Sox, but he had bounced around the minor leagues and Minnie Mioso had beaten him to the White Sox by four months. After accumulating a mere 18 at-bats in 1951, Boyd never saw the big leagues in 1952, despite leading both the AAA Pacific Coast League and the Puerto Rican Winter League in batting average that year. But unlike some earlier black players, he got another chance. He made the most of another shot with the White Sox in 1953 by hitting .297 in 55 games, yet was sent back to the minors, where he languished for most of 1954 and all of 55.  But, persevering as strongly as Simpson (or indeed, as Robinson), Boyd was signed by the Baltimore Orioles before the 1956 season, where he finally earned a regular spot on a major-league roster.  He spent five seasons with the Os, batting over .300 in four of those years, albeit with very little power.  He remained in MLB until he was 41 years old.        Both Simpson and Boyd had long careers defined by the perseverance that we attribute to many more famous pioneers. Each carried the additional burden of being black non-stars, constantly having to justify their professional existences. Consequently, by one important set of criterialong careers characterized by performances basically equivalent to that of an average white playerthey were unmistakable pioneers of integration. They hung around the big leagues in a way that previously only white men had.To acknowledge the careers of Simpson and Boyd is not to diminish the importance of Jackie Robinson. Instead, this reframing should highlight the enormity of Robinsons talent, and the absurd fact that black players had to be transcendent in order to receive an opportunity. More broadly, Simpson and Boyd can teach us an important lesson: If we are ever going to have responsible conversations about barrier-breaking in any paradigm, then exceptional individuals like Robinson can never be the only focus. We must not conflate the excellence of individuals who appeared first with institutional inclusion. They are not the same. Inclusion, maybe the buzziest workforce concept of our time, should instead be measured by how we treat the Harry Simpsons and Bob Boyds among us. We should ask whether everyone in our setting is allowed equal access to mediocrity. If the answer is no, then that institution is not inclusive, even if it has a Jackie Robinson.AdvertisementC.

He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot  estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's  projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name  'Crush'  for a reason."Renato Nez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vzquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velzquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vzquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vzquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsBy Tim Collins For Mailonline  Published: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019   4View  commentsMore than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland.An international research team traced more than ten generations in the same grave.They said their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.More than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland. This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Swedensequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe.The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland.The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmstrm, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths.Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.

A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia.These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and thelevel of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupIn a huge blow to Marquette's preseason top-five hopes, the Golden Eagles announced Monday that forwards Sam Hauser and Joey Hauser would be transferring out of the program.Sam Hauser told ESPN that he and his brother are planning to go to the same school.Sam Hauser will have to sit one year before playing his final season because he will not be a graduate transfer. Joey Hauser will have three years of eligibility after sitting out next season."We are thankful for all that Sam and Joey contributed to our program and University during their time at Marquette and wish them the best of luck in the future," head coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of returning players and are extremely excited about the upcoming season and future of our program."Sam, a 6-foot-8 junior, averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He shot 40.2 percent from 3-point range, marking the third season in a row he's made at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers.Joey, a 6-foot-9 freshman, averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his first season at Marquette. He also shot 42.5 percent from 3.Both players are officially in the transfer portal, sources told ESPN.With leading scorer Markus Howard back, Wojciechowski expected to have one of the best teams in the country next season. Without the Hausers, the Golden Eagles will likely fall toward the back end of the preseason top 25.Meanwhile, the Hausers will be two of the most sought-after transfers on the market.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?Photos of the Lyman Memorial baseball team

In Brendan Shanahans first season running the Maple Leafs, he was so concerned about the direction in which Nazem Kadris career was going, he suspended him from the team, essentially for insubordination.In that season of discovery and disappointment, Shanahan figured that there was enough about Kadri worth fighting for  so much so that, when he called him to his office to explain the internal suspension, he didnt call him alone.He included his parents in the meeting, which is extraordinarily rare for anything that happens in professional sport. Players, yes. Agents, yes. But parents?Shanahan wanted the London-based Kadri family, mom and dad, to know how much he cared for the hockey player, the person, their son, the talent level. And he wanted Kadris parents to have a full understanding of what the expectation was to being a Maple Leaf.That was in 2015. For the most part, since that meeting, before all the roster changes and the coaching changes were made, Kadri has been a rather plentiful and effective Leafs player, one of the real success stories of Mike Babcocks time coaching here.But there has always been some worry about him taking the wrong steps, being in the wrong place, in the wrong time. Lou Lamoriello told him that when he signed him to a long-term contract in Toronto. He told him he believed in him. He told him he was a significant building block for a team going from nowhere to somewhere.But there was always this slight concern about the former London Knights star  that decision-making wasnt always a strength, that leadership didnt come naturally to him, that he had to be pushed and prodded and guided to become the rather effective National Hockey League player he has become.In his early years, if the team was going to a bar after the game, Kadri would go to the bar. And if the team was going to the gym to work out, Kadri would go to the gym. There are some players who just arent natural leaders in any way  and Kadri seemed to head in whatever direction the wind was blowing.Most of that was before Babcock got ahold of him, helped develop a style and a role and an important place on the Maple Leafs roster. Kadri had been a target for Ron Wilson, for Dallas Eakins with the Marlies, for Peter Horachek, who came after Randy Carlyle. The talent was there; the natural maturity wasnt.When left to play on his own instincts, his talent, his bravery, his ability to score 30 goals shone. But there was always that concern: When was he going to do the wrong thing? He did it in last years first-round series against the Bruins when he was suspended for three games for boarding Bostons Tommy Wingels. The Leafs were fortunate that Lamoriello had brought in the veteran Tomas Plekanec, who filled Kadris spot rather neatly at a time when it seemed impossible.This year, with Lamoriello gone, with Kyle Dubas in charge of the roster, the Leafs brought in Nic Petan at the trade deadline, but not to fill the kind of role Kadri will now be abandoning. He is the wrong size and the wrong fit to play against the Boston Bruins.On Monday, the expectation is that Kadri, 28, will be suspended for his undisciplined and unnecessary cross-check to the neck of Jake DeBrusk and its entirely possible he wont play another game in the first round against the Bruins.That judgment seems harsh from the outside and maybe even from the inside, but this is what happens as a multi-time offender in the NHL. Kadri will likely be penalized for this crime and previous crimes and the Leafs dont really have a replacement for him  or anyone up front who relishes the physical game and the nasty game the way Kadri does.With John Tavares signing in Toronto, Kadris role changed this season. His goals dropped from 32 to 16 although he seemed to accept his new situation rather handily.He played first power-play. He played with a variety of wingers. He was, as he has been since Shanahan first suspended him, a dependable player of sorts.Then came Saturday night in Boston. And not only did the Bruins clearly target the Leafs physically, they went hard at Kadri. They went at him, knowing they can get to him. There was a knee-on-knee situation with DeBrusk that probably should have been called a penalty earlier in the game. But when DeBrusk went unnecessarily hard at Patrick Marleau late in Game 2, Kadri responded both properly and recklessly.Marleau is like everyones father on the Leafs. You see someone abusing your father, how would you respond? Kadri lost it. He cross- checked DeBrusk, getting a major penalty and a game misconduct and whatever suspension comes down Monday.Said one Bruins coach: All Kadri had to do was lower his hands slightly. Had he cross-checked DeBrusk across the chest instead of the neck/head area, he would have got a two-minute penalty  or, the way the referees called this game, maybe no penalty at all.But he was obvious in his actions and he left the officials and the off-ice officials no choice at all and now the Leafs will play the next games  we dont know how many  without their third-line centre on a team that doesnt really have a fourth-line centre.There is much to like about Kadri including the size of his contract and his bold personality. But what is difficult to like is his lack of dependability in big moments and his lack of emotional maturity when it matters. In some ways, this goes back to Shanahans original meeting with him.We like Nazem Kadri, Shanahan said four years ago. We expect a certain level of professionalism. Its time for him to start making better decisions.It was time then. Its still time now.ssimmons@postmedia.comtwitter.com/simmonssteve365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

A Mississauga woman was shot with a crossbow when she answered the door to a fake delivery man in a targeted attack Peel police say they believe was carried out by a hit man and was meant to kill her.The 44-year-old victim survived the bizarre 8 p.m. attack on her front doorstep on Bayberry Dr. in the area of Winston Churchill Blvd. and Argentia Rd. on Nov. 7, but she will never be the same again, according to police."The injuries that she sustained were absolutely devastating," said Peel police Det. Sgt. Jim Kettles at a news conference. "It involved damage to a lot of her internal organs. She'll be in recovery phase for the rest of her life  Her life will never be the same."Police have released video and photographs of the suspect hoping someone in the community can help identify him. A special hotline to try to catch the would-be killer has been set up at 905-456-5840."This was most definitely a targeted type of attack," Kettles said.The victim was alone at the time and answered the door to someone dressed like a delivery man who was carrying a large package. Police said inside the box was a crossbow, the kind commonly used by hunters to kill moose and other large game. Police believe the man was holding the handle of the crossbow through a hole in one end of the box as he pointed it at the victim."The crossbow was never removed from the box," Kettles said.The victim and 'delivery man' had a brief conversation, and then the man shot her in the chest. She was able to close the door as he ran, and call 911.She saw him clearly, but did not recognize him, according to police."Comments made to the victim (by the suspect) indicate the victim was targeted and that the suspect may have carried out the attack at the request of another individual," said Supt. Heather Raymor. "It is clear that this attack was meant to end the victim's life."Police believe the man who shot her escaped in a dark coloured pickup truck.The victim spent months in hospital following the attack."We are doing everything we can to support her right now," Kettles said. "She's in a place of safety. She will continue to have a struggle to get back to her new normal, considering the injuries she sustained."He said police are ensuring her safety, and there are "potential motives" investigators have identified, but they aren't revealing any and are still looking for others."We are open to anything at this point and we are looking at all possible investigative avenues," Kettles said.He noted the suspect's baseball hat appears distinctive, although they cannot identify a make, and his shoes are also distinctive, and they are hoping his clothing or his face trigger a memory in someone.Kettles noted the suspect did not cover his face, but may have been wearing a wig under the hat.Information can also be provided to police anonymously through Peel Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-8477 Police also released a video showing a portion of the attack.

                     The Hurricanes (25-12, 10-8 Atlantic Coast Conference) are ranked No. 22 in the Collegiate Baseball poll released Monday.
                 
  It is the first time the Hurricanes have been ranked under first-year head coach Gino DiMare.
                     Miami was 5-0 last week, beating Florida Gulf Coast in a pair of midweek games before sweeping Virginia in ACC play.
                     "We talked about it before the series began, that now is the time to make a move," DiMare said. "We have been sitting kind of on the outside, looking in, in terms of rankings, and our goal is to try and host. Nobody is giving us a chance to host, but if we make a really, really good run here, we will have a chance to do that."
                     The Hurricanes are ranked for the first time since February 2018.
                     Miami hosts Florida Gulf Coast again Tuesday before a three-game series at No. 8 Louisville.
                              Copyright 2019 by WPLG Local10.com - All rights reserved.Get email alerts for local stories and events around the world.A U.S. House bill co-sponsored by Representatives David Cicilline, D-R.I., and Doug Collins, R-Ga., aims to give newspapers a fighting chance in todays technological world. The bill addresses the imbalance that has developed as readers have migrated from paid news sources to such free electronic news platforms as Facebook.That may sound like inside baseball, but in the balance hangs a question that matters greatly to our society: How will providers of local news keep reporting and delivering accurate information to readers?Its becoming an existential question for news companies but also for those who care about accountability and transparency in local government, business, sports and the arts. As the bills text puts it, America benefits from, and depends upon, not only a free marketplace for goods and services, but also a free marketplace of ideas. If the news providers fade away, then users of news distributors such as Facebook and Google will be less well-informed.The Cicilline-Collins bill, known as the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, would carve out the space and time needed for news providers to strike revenue-sharing terms with the dominant online news distributors.A broad array of allies, from 47 state press associations to public-interest groups such as the Open Markets Institute, support the House bill. At the same time, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebooks founder and chief executive, acknowledges a willingness to begin paying news providers for the information  or, in digital parlance, content  that Facebook delivers to its users. Facebook is far and away the largest social media distributor of news.Mr. Zuckerberg said quality journalism plays a role in building informed communities and Facebook has the means to support it as it offers it to its users. Facebook, he said, could potentially have a direct relationship with publishers to make sure that their content is available, if its really high-quality content.Put simply, both sides  news providers and online distributors  need each other, and could move toward a financial accommodation that might serve each others interests. Thats encouraging, but time is of the essence, which is where the Cicilline-Collins bill comes in.It would provide a four-year safe harbor window for publishers to collectively negotiate terms with leading digital companies. The collective negotiation would include publishers of all sizes and types, from weekly newspapers in Eastern Massachusetts to online-only news services based in California. Its aim is to ensure that citizens who care about matters in the public interest, from local police oversight to foreign affairs, will continue to have access to reliable and informed sources of information.Consider the picture for the newspaper business: Total revenues topped $49 billion a year as recently as 2006, but fell into the $16 billion range in 2017, according to the Pew Research Center. Newsroom employment plummeted about 45 percent, to about 39,000 reporters, editors, photographers and others during the same period, Pew reports.That represents a steep decline in newspapers ability to cover school boards, state houses and regional affairs. Similar trends are apparent in the broadcast news industry. Less coverage, of course, means less government accountability, a disaster for our political system.The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act would cost the public nothing, and could pay off in promoting high-quality news. It deserves widespread support Copyright 2006-2019 GateHouse Media, LLC.

Ao invs de reagir  atitude dele, eu mudei de lugar. Isso no parou ele. Ele comeou a empurrar uma cadeira em cima de mim, para me provocar, gritava comigo e ficava gritando o nome James Franco'". Em um certo ponto, eu levantei e Johnny me chutou nas costas, me fazendo cair. Ele jogou a bota dele em mim enquanto eu estava no cho. Johnny continuava a gritar obscenidades para mim at que ele foi para o banheiro do avio e desmaiou trancado pelo resto da viagem".No dia seguinte, o ator teria se desculpado com a at, ento, esposa: "De novo, eu estou me sentindo envergonhado e arrependido. Me desculpe. Eu realmente no sei o que aconteceu e por que aconteceu. Mas eu jamais farei isso de novo. Minha doena veio de mansinho e me pegou... eu tenho que melhorar. De novo, eu sinto muito, muito mesmo... Eu te amo e me sinto muito mal de ter te decepcionado".Stephen Reuters, assistente do ator, tambm mandou uma mensagem afirmando que Johnny: "estava chocado. Quando eu disse para ele que ele te chutou, ele chorou. Ele  um garotinho perdido e precisa de toda a ajuda que puder".Apaixonada, Amber continuou no relacionamento e casou com Johnny, que supostamente estava longe das drogas, em fevereiro de 2015. No entanto, apenas um ms aps o casamento, as agresses continuaram, quando a atriz pegou o ento marido usando ecstasy:"Johnny me disse que eu no tinha proibido ele explicitamente de usar ecstasy. A briga foi esquentando e Johnny me empurrou, me deu um tapa e me jogou no cho antes de eu correr para um banheiro e me trancar".Na manh seguinte, "eu desci as escadas para descobrir que Johnny ainda estava acordado e que no dormiu a noite toda, tomando oito comprimidos de MDMA. Ele tambm estava bebendo. Ns entramos em uma briga que Johnny tornou fsica. Eu me tranquei em um dos quartos. Isso no parou Johnny de arrombar a porta. No comeo da noite, Johnny havia me batido vrias vezes, me empurrado e me jogado no cho. Ele tambm me enforcou e cuspiu no meu rosto. Johnny ento me deu uma garrafa de licor que estava bebendo e disse: O que voc vai fazer?'. Eu joguei a garrafa no cho. Johnny reagiu comeando a jogar latas e garrafas de vidro fechadas em mim..."."Aquela noite, Johnny me jogou em uma mesa de ping pong que quebrou comigo em cima. Ele jogou garrafas pelos buracos de uma porta de vidro, quebrando dois painis e deixando vidro em todo o lugar. Ento ele me agarrou, apertando o meu corpo. Ele tirou meu pijama e em certo ponto eu estava pelada e descala, coberta de lcool e vidro. Johnny me pegou pelo cabelo e me enforcou enquanto me empurrava na geladeira da cozinha. Eu tentei levantar, mas eu estava escorregando no vidro que estava no cho. Ele me jogou para longe dele e eu tentei correr, mas Johnny continuava a arremessar objetos e lcool em mim".Amber Heard revela como foi difcil falar sobre sua sexualidade com seus pais"Em uma das cenas mais assustadoras e horrveis desses trs dias seguidos, Johnny me pegou pelo pescoo e me jogou em uma bancada. Eu tentava levantar enquanto ele me enforcava, mas meus braos e pernas ficavam escorregando no lcool que estava no cho e na bancada, o que me cortou inteira. Com medo por minha vida, eu disse para Johnny: Voc est me machucando e me cortando'. Ele me ignorou, continuando a me bater nas costas com a mo fechada e batendo com um telefone de plstico na parede com a outra mo, at ele virar pedaos. Enquanto ele batia o telefone na parede, ele machucou o dedo, cortando a ponta dele... Assim que eu sai de perto, eu me tranquei em um quarto no andar de cima. No terceiro dia que Johnny estava acordado dem dormir, eu desci e achei vrias mensagens que ele tinha escrito para mim pela casa, nas paredes, nas roupas. Elas foram escritas com uma mistura de tinta  leo e o sangue que estava em seu dedo. Ele tambm fez xixi na casa toda". Quando o ator foi hospitalizado, Amber estava "com o lbio cortado, o nariz inchado e cortes pelo corpo todo... at hoje, eu tenho cicatrizes no brao e nos ps por causa desse dia", contou.A estrela ainda contou detalhes sobre um episdio do qual impediu que Johnny empurrasse sua irm mais nova da escada, agredindo-o: "Ele comeou a destruir as coisas pela casa, inclusive minhas coisas que estavam no armrio Johnny ameaou me bater, Whitney se colocou entre ns. Johnny virou a ateno para Whitney, que estava na beirada da escada, e foi para cima dela. Agindo em defesa da minha irm, porque eu estava com medo pela sade fsica, eu acertei Johnny no rosto para que a ateno dele sasse dela. Essa foi a nica vez que eu bati no Johnny. Ele estava prestes a empurrar minha irm da escada. Eu agi em defesa da vida dela".No entanto, as agresses no pararam por a, em Agosto de 2015, durante uma viagem da Thailndia para a Malsia, "enquanto estvamos no trem Eastern Oriental, Johnny comeou a brigar comigo e comeou a me bater e empurrar emu ma parede, enquanto agarrava minha garganta e me segurava ali. Eu me lembro de ter ficado com medo de Johnny no saber o momento de parar e me matar".E ento, mais uma briga, que rolou em dezembro de 2015, no apartamento deles em Los Angeles: "Johnny comeou a brigar comigo. Ele jogou um cantil em mim, bateu em objetos do quarto e socou a parede. Ele me deu um tapa forte, agarrou meu cabelo e me arrastou pela escada do escritrio at a sala de estar, depois at a cozinha, da cozinha at o quarto e ento para o quarto de hspedes. Neste processo, ele arrancou vrios punhados de cabelo e cortou minha cabea. Esperando evitar violncia, eu tentei acalm-lo e ento fui para a escada, tentando me tirar da situao. Johnny me seguiu, bateu nas minhas costas, agarrou meu cabelo, me deixou em frente  escada e, ento, me arrastou pelos ltimos degraus. No topo da escada, Johnny me empurrou duas vezes, o que me fez ter medo de cair. Eu disse para Johnny que ele tinha quebrado meu tornozelo na tentativa dele parar. Johnny continuou me batendo e toda vez que ele me nocauteava, eu decidi apenas reagir parade e olhando para ele nos olhos. Johnny me respondeu gritando, Ah, voc acha que  uma porr* de um garoto duro?'. Ele recoou e socou meu rosto, acertando meu nariz, que imediatamente comeou a sangrar e causou uma dor sria no meu rosto. Eu comecei a chorar e eu pensei que teria que ir ao hospital. Eu disse Johnny que eu queria deixa deix-lo e que eu chamaria a polcia se ele tocasse em mim de novo. Quando eu comecei a sair do quarto de hspedes, ele me bateu, me agarrou e me empurrou de quarto em quarto, segurando meu cabelo".Equipe de Amber Heard acusa Johnny Depp de fazer "abuso psicolgico""Nesta hora, Johnny tinha me arrastado pela escada do escritrio, eu disse para ele que eu estava deixando ele, j que no aturava mais esse comportamento dele. Johnny reagiu me agarando pela garganta, me jogando no cho e batendo na minha cabea. Ele segurou meu cabelo, me estapeou o rosto e gritava algo como, Eu vou te matar. Eu vou te matar, est me ouvindo?'. Tinha cabelo meu espalhado por todo lugar onde eu tinha sido arrastada. A briga continuous na cama. Johnny me segurou com os joelhos nas minhas costas e com o outro p na beira da cama, enquanto me batia na cabea repetidamente e gritava o mais alto que eu j tinha ouvido, Eu te odeio', vrias e vrias vezes. A armao da cama quebrou por causa do peso e presso. Johnny me bateu com os pulsos fechados e eu lembro que no conseguiua ouvir meus gritos, porque ele empurrou minha cabea contra o colcho. Eu gritei o mais alto que podia, esperando que Johnny percebesse que estava me machucando muito"."Durante um tempo, eu no podia gritar ou respirar. Eu estava preocupada que Johnny estava totalmente num estado de cegueira e no soubesse o que estava fazendo e que ele realmente pudesse me matar. Copos quebrados e piunhados de cabelos estavam na escada Johnny tambm escreveu mensagens na cozinha, que diziam, Por que ser uma fraude? Tudo  uma idiotice".Para finalizar, Amber contou sobre a briga que causou a separao deles, em Maio de 2016: "Ele estava como um jogador de baseball e jogou o celular no meu rosto, o mais forte que pode. Eu gritei, Voc acertou meu rosto', e comecei a chorar Johnny pegou meu cabelo e comeou a me tapear, me balanar pelo local enquanto eu continuava gritando".Heard contou que um vizinho ouviu seus gritos e entrou no apartamento, se jogando entre eles, implorando para que Depp parasse, enquanto gritava, "Amber, d o fora daqui"."Johnny jogou vrios objetos pela casa, incluindo uma garrafa de vinho Johnny jogou mais objetos no corredor, cuspiu vinho em todo lugar e fez um buraco em uma parede".Logo depois, o ator entrou em outro apartamento de Amber, "Johnny destruiu tudo que pode e perseguiu Liz Marz (maquiadora) para fora do apartamento segurando uma garrafa de vinho".Logo aps isso, a atriz pediu o divrcio e como se no bastasse todo o sofrimento, ainda foi acusada de mentirosa por fs do ator, que a ameaam de morte at hoje em dia!

Don't forget to  "like" us on Facebook!The Boston Red Sox were supposed to contend with the New York Yankees for the American League East title. Instead, they are 6-10 and limping into a series against the Yankees beginning Tuesday evening. Chris Sale, the team's ace, is at the heart of the matter, and if he doesn't improve soon, the Red Sox will be playing catch-up all season.Sale is 0-3 with a 9.00 ERA, his 13 earned runs in 2019 more than a third of the 37 runs he allowed over 27 starts all of last year. He is striking out a career-low 13 percent of batters faced and walking almost 7 percent, his highest rate since 2012 as a member of the Chicago White Sox. His swinging strike percentage (10.5 percent) is also at its lowest point since 2012, and hitters are making better contact against him than they have in the past four years, hitting the ball on the sweet spot of the bat once out of every 12 balls put in play.The most concerning stat for Sale, and the Red Sox, is his four-seam fastball velocity, which has tumbled from an average of 95.6 mph in 2018 to 91.5 mph this season, the most noticeable dip occurring after suffering a shoulder injury late last season. The injury could be a lingering issue but that didn't stop the team from inking the 30-year-old to a five-year, $145 million contract extension this winter.Regardless, the effectiveness of Sale's fastball is nowhere near where it needs to be right now. Batters aren't swinging as much on his fastball because Sale isn't throwing it in the zone as often - down from 53 percent to 41 percent in just one season. The swinging strike rate on this pitch is also a paltry 1.3 percent."The stuff, we know, wasn't there," Cora told Steve Hewitt of the Boston Herald. "I think the off-speed pitch is the one that, he's not consistent with it. Everyone talks about the fastball, but for me, it's the slider. It's the best slider in the game, and right now it's not that."Sale's slider, used against both right- and left-handed batters, has been a commanding pitch. From 2017 to 2018, batters hit just .181 against the pitch with 141 strikeouts over 276 at-bats. This year, batters are hitting .217 against it with four strikeouts in 23 at-bats, illustrating it is still an effective offering. And its decline is nowhere near the decline of his fastball. For example, his slider saved the team over two runs per 100 times thrown in 2018, which has dropped to break even in 2019. His fastball, on the other hand, saved the team nearly a run every 100 times thrown last year but is now costing the Red Sox six runs per 100 times thrown in 2019 - the worst rate among starting pitchers.The rest of the starting rotation also doesn't appear to be able to pick up the slack. It has a combined 6.17 FIP - a team's ERA over a given period of time if the pitcher were to have experienced league-average results on balls in play and league-average timing  second worst only to the Baltimore Orioles (6.41 FIP) largely in part to allowing 28 more runs to score than we would expect given the number of outs and men on base during each plate appearance, the most in the majors and eight more than the next worst rotation, the Chicago White Sox.Here's the bottom line: Sale was projected to be the most valuable pitcher in the AL this year (5.8 wins above replacement) and the second most valuable pitcher in the majors after New York Mets ace Jacob deGrom. Those projections have since been revised to 4.3 fWAR in 2019. One win may not sound like a lot but consider how tight the race is in the AL East. New York has a 57 percent chance to win the division with 95 wins, the Tampa Bay Rays have the next-best chance at 25 percent (91 wins) followed by Boston (18 percent, 89 wins). The Red Sox are now barely above a 50/50 chance to make the playoffs, per FanGraphs. They were given a 90 percent chance to make the playoffs at the start of the season.First published by The Washington PostAaron Beard, Ap Sports WriterRALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSign up for The Whistle, the GametimeCT newsletter, to get the best, most up-to-the-minute, engaging high school sports coverage in the state.Have an existing account?Already have a subscription?Don't have an account?Get the newsLet friends in your social network know what you are reading aboutLaBelle right-hander Tyler Nesbitt, who signed with Florida, and Riverdale lefty Carson Palmquist, who committed to Miami, garnering MLB looks.A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

    LaBelle RHP Tyler Nesbitt and Riverdale LHP Carson Palmquist have brought MLB teams to Southwest Florida as both already are heading to Florida and Miami respectively next fall.
    Bryan Cooney, bcooney@news-press.comIt may have been a preseason baseball game between LaBelle and Riverdale high schools on Feb. 21, but from the throng of radar guns pointed at the field that night, it was obviously a lot more.Major League teams wanted to get a look at two of the top arms in Southwest Florida, LaBelle's Tyler Nesbitt and Riverdale's Carson Palmquist."I definitely never imagined seeing that many people, it was packed," Nesbitt said. "I'm not used to having guys watch me throw in the bullpen, taking notes on their notepad."LaBelle pitcher Tyler Nesbitt during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers ,Tuesday, April 9, 2019.(Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Nearly every MLB club has been in the area to keep tabs on the hard-throwing Cowboys right-hander and the lanky Raiders left-hander this spring.Nesbitt's fastball has hit 94 miles per hour and he utilizes a sharp breaking ball to put hitters away. Palmquist's delivery mimics that of former FGCU star and Boston Red Sox ace Chris Sale and features an upper-80s fastball and wicked curveball.More: Palmquist, Cutler power Riverdale by LaBelleThe players are committed to top in-state baseball programs, but whether they ever show up on campus will depend on what the scouts are writing in those notebooks.Palmquist committed to Miami in August 2016 and said he thinks to have the college experience and to beable tolearn on and off the field is very appealing."I'd love to play in the major leagues, but I'm thinking college would be the best option," Palmquist said. "I can only get better there, throw harder, and I can learn so that if I don't ever play baseball after college, I'd still have the Miami degree. Not many people can say that. You can only go through this once, you can't go back and be a teenager again."Riverdale High School pitcher Carson Palmquist during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019.(Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Riverdale has produced three major leaguers and a number of players that played minor league baseball. Pitcher Kris Foster and outfielders Tommy Watkins and Kyle Waldrop all appeared in Big League games. Palmquist's older brother Cody pitched five seasons in the minors after graduating from Riverdale in 2012 and has been a critical influence on Carson.Riverdale head baseball coach Rob Pringle puts Palmquist at the top of the list of pitchers he has had in his 24 years with the Raiders but highlighted one thing that separates Palmquist."He's a competitor, he just loves to compete," Pringle said. "I've had a chance to have a lot of kids here, and he's as good as I've had."A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Palmquist has been dominant so far this season, going 5-1 while throwing 35 2/3 innings entering this week with 66 strikeouts and has allowed just six hits with an 0.79 ERA. He also threw a no-hitter with 15 strikeouts against Naples on March 26.LaBelle head baseball coach Jeff Burton touts Nesbitt as the shining example he wants his team to aspire to be."It's just nice to have a kid that has worked hard and everybody knows that he's worked hard and sees that, 'Hey, it can work out here'," Burton said. "We have our saying out there of don't let being good get in the way of being great. He has worked hard and not been satisfied."Originally committing to Florida Gulf Coast as a sophomore, Nesbitt had an outstanding summer campaign participating in Perfect Game baseball events before the start of his senior year. Reaching into the low-90s with his fastball, bigger schools began calling and Nesbitt made the tough call to de-commit from his hometown team.LaBelle pitcher Kyle Nesbitt during the Battle of the Boarder Baseball Tournament in  Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019.(Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)At the WWBA Championship in Jupiter, Nesbitt had 10 strikeouts in five innings in one outing that led to him being named the tournament's top pitcher. As a lifelong Florida Gators fan, an offer was extended immediately which Nesbitt quickly accepted and signed. Whether or not Nesbitt makes it to Gainesville will be decided by June's MLB Draft."There's no bad decision for me," said Nesbitt, listed in Baseball America's Top 100prospects. "I'd have way more resources at Florida than I would here, and I can only better myself. Florida's been my dream school, I'm a diehard Gator fan."Nesbitt has delivered this year for LaBelle, going 6-1 with a 1.08 ERA and three no-hitters over 39 innings pitched. He has thrown six complete games, striking out 69 with five walks and six earned runs allowed.The pitchers hope to finishtheir high school careers with long playoff runs. That would set up higher profile matchups against some of Florida's best teams, which could provide another chance to boost their draft stocks.Nesbitt pointed to a matchup with North Broward Prep in the playoffs last year, that featured 38th overall pick Xavier Edwards.Riverdale High School pitcher Carson Palmquist during the Battle of the Border Baseball Tournament in Fort Myers, Tuesday, April 9, 2019.(Photo: Chris Tilley/Special to The News-Press)Riverdale could possibly face defending 7A champion Venice which would be a huge test for Palmquist."Making the Final Four has been my ultimate goal for four years," Palmquist said. "This year, our team is so close, we all hang out all the time and we're good friends. I think we're goingto be able to make a far run."CHICAGO  Snow and rain led to the postponement of Sunday's finale of a three-game series between the Los Angeles Angels and Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field.A makeup date was not immediately announced.A steady snow fell throughout the morning and a mix of snow and rain was forecast to continue throughout the afternoon.Right-hander Tyler Chatwood (0-0, 6.00 ERA) was scheduled to make his first start of the season on Sunday for Chicago. He will pitch Monday night when the Cubs open a three-game series at Miami.Right-hander Trevor Cahill (1-1, 3.50 ERA) will start for the Angels in the opener of a three-game series at Texas on Monday night.

		Powered by WordPress.com VIP Ken Powtak, Associated PressCaptionCloseBOSTON (AP)  Chris Davis knows his homer went a lot further than teammate Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-run shot. He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot  estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's  projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name  'Crush'  for a reason."Renato Nez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vzquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velzquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vzquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vzquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsSign up for The Whistle, the GametimeCT newsletter, to get the best, most up-to-the-minute, engaging high school sports coverage in the state.NEW YORK  Ravaged by injuries, the New York Yankees hardly resemble the 100-win team that set a major league record for homers last year.And even though it's very early in the season, they are frittering away games during a favorable portion of their schedule.Tim Anderson hit his first career grand slam and Carlos Rodn pitched the Chicago White Sox to a 5-2 victory over the scuffling Yankees on Sunday. New York is 3-6 at home against the Orioles, Tigers and White Sox  all projected also-rans that lost at least 98 games last year."It's frustrating to lose two out of three to a team that we should probably beat," first baseman Luke Voit said. "I think a lot of us just need to get out of our heads and go back to playing Yankee baseball the right way."Rodn (2-2) allowed three hits in six innings and struck out five , improving to 3-0 in three starts at Yankee Stadium. He retired his final 11 batters after a visit from pitching coach Don Cooper.Four relievers finished a four-hitter, with Alex Colom getting three quick outs for his third save."I found a groove after the third," Rodn said. "This is a playoff club, the Yankees are. I think this is a good series win for us. Hopefully we can build off it and get some momentum going."

James Stack, killed in action in Afghanistan. Just having a room full of people giving back and giving them a way to give back. The charity starts with the veterans because they give us the freedom of speech, and the freedom to come and go as we please.Volunteers met April 7 to pack the boxes.VFW Post 981 Commander Steve MacInnes, who served in the Air Force during the Vietnam War, remembers the boxes he received while serving.What it means to them is everything. When youre overseas and youre in combat, you like to receive things from home when you can, he said. To be able to send out over 1,000 boxes to troops overseas, were showing them we still care about them and theyre important to us.Hedrick accepted thousands of donations in 45 collection boxes in towns from Fox Lake to Park Ridge and also in the police departments of Arlington Heights, Buffalo Grove, Lake Zurich and Barrington.She asked volunteers on April 7 to pack each box with love and Girl Scout cookies, snacks, candy, toiletries, socks, dice, cards, little travel games, three to four letters from kids and a letter from the Hedrick and Stack families.Hedrick received 53 military addresses to which she will ship 20 boxes for distribution to others who havent received anything from home. Shipping will cost  more than $17,000. Shes still accepting donations at the charitys website helpusatroops.com.Since 2011, Help USA Troops has sent more than 4,300 packages, according to organizers.I dont think we do enough as a community, I dont think we do enough as a country, Hedrick said. Theyre serving our country, theyre risking their lives and their families are risking everything for us.Her daughter Katie Stack was only 19 with 1-year-old daughter Mikayla when she lost James, her husband of just over a year, six weeks after he was deployed in September 2010. She feels his loss during the packing event.It doesnt hit me until we gather around and we see the color guard and the national anthem plays, I will come to the realization that all of these individuals are here to honor my husband  and to just support all of the troops who have their lost their lives and given the ultimate sacrifice, said Stack, adding she has many military friends who have returned as amputees who also need to be recognized.I like how my mom started this, how much its grown and knowing we can keep his memory alive and give back. Knowing all these people do it in memory of him and in honor of our troops, it helps me.Stack and her daughter were the first to pack a box, followed by other Gold Star families and volunteers who  worked their way around an assembly line packed with goodies.MacInnes post, which meets at the Amvets in Wheeling, has been actively supporting this event since it started.In my opinion, this is what its all about, to honor our veterans and those who are no longer with us and to give to our troops overseas, MacInnes said. Thats done in remembrance of James, but it also has such a deep meaning to us, as veterans of foreign wars. We think its extremely important that we never forget those who have sacrificed their lives.State Rep. Mark Walker, D-Arlington Heights, and state Sen. Ann Gillespie, D-Arlington Heights, joined volunteers packing boxes.People are still serving and dying overseas and theyre not to be forgotten, said Walker, who served in the Army during the Vietnam War. Theyre so many sacrifices that we tend to not remember. They love getting packages, at least I did. Its really important  and theres nothing like Girl Scout cookies.Added Gillespie: We forget people have been over in Afghanistan for 20 years.Joe Fox, 17, joined his Buffalo Grove High School baseball teammates in loading boxes onto a truck.I thought this was a good way to give back and do it with some of my teammates, he said.Hedrick plans to continue her mission.Well keep doing this until they all come home, Hedrick told the crowd, giving next years dates of April 25-26. I dont see this ending any time soon.Elizabeth Owens-Schiele is a freelance reporter for Pioneer Press.AdvertisementSupported byBy Kevin ArmstrongPHILADELPHIA  With Noah Syndergaard set to start the series opener against the Phillies on Monday, Mets Manager Mickey Callaway stood in his office, and noted that Jacob deGrom, the starter in the previous nights loss, had reviewed video of the defeat.Jake looked at it for about 45 minute last night and saw some stuff that he feels like can help him, Callaway said.After not giving up a run in his first two starts, deGrom, who posted a 1.70 earned run average as the Cy Young Award winner in the National League last season, has yielded a combined nine runs in his last two outings, both of which resulted in losses.DeGrom can now pass the remote control to Syndergaard, who will be seeking his own answers after giving up five earned runs in five innings during the Mets 7-6 victory in 11 innings at Citizens Bank Park. Once again, it was the Mets offense that bailed out the pitching to improve the teams record to 10-6 on the season.We got away with some stuff tonight, but we still came up with a win, Callaway said. That says a lot.Relief pitchers Jeurys Familia and Robert Gsellman will also want to take a closer look at their work after their struggles on Monday night. Familia inherited a 6-5 lead in the eighth inning before loading the bases and being replaced by Gsellman, who proceeded to walk in a run on four pitches to tie the score.It feels really good to win that one, Syndergaard said. I didnt necessarily do my job, but the offense did a really good job of getting to a really talented pitcher early. I did a pretty good job of giving those runs back.Catcher Wilson Ramos, left fielder/third baseman Jeff McNeil and second baseman Robinson Cano all drove in at least one run, and center fielder Brandon Nimmo put the Mets ahead, 6-5, with his third home run of the season in the top of the sixth.In the top of the 11th, Juan Lagares reached base on an infield hit and eventually scored when Phillies first baseman Rhys Hoskins couldnt handle Michael Confortos sharp grounder. Hoskins was charged with an error on the play.I saw he didnt catch the ball, so I go with everything I got, Lagares said.McNeil, who was 3 for 5 at the plate, made the biggest defensive play of the game, diving to to his left in the bottom of the eighth to snare a ball that was rocketed at him by Phillies third baseman Maikel Franco and then turn it into a double play. The play by McNeil, which came with runners on first and second and no one out, kept the Phillies from a potentially big inning that would have decided the game, although Philadelphia ended up tying the score, anyway.Afterward, McNeil maintained that the extra-inning win over a division rival was a statement the win-now Mets needed to make.Theyre a good team, he said, and were a great team.In any case, the night ended with a victory for the Mets. And here is where things stand with them over all:Command has been a concern.Jason Vargas, the fifth starter, has started two games, was skipped in the rotation once and made a relief appearance in the ninth inning of a loss. By the time he got out of that inning, he had given up four more earned runs. His earned run average is currently 14.21.Pitching was billed as the Mets strength heading into the season, but all five starters have had issues with their feel for the ball or efficiency thus far.Steven Matz provided a bright spot over the weekend, as he limited the Braves to two earned runs in six innings and picked up his first win of the season. He struck out eight.But with Vargas showing little to be optimistic about and deGrom unable to keep up the pace of his first two starts  let alone his 2018 season  plenty of fans are already calling for the Mets to sign Dallas Keuchel, the free agent starter who is available if the Mets are willing to write another check.Edwin Diaz, known as Sugar, came in to collect his sixth save, and his E.R.A. is down to 1.35. Callaway noted afterward that he will not use Diaz for more than three outs on the road unless necessary.When we get to the playoffs, he will be available for more than three outs, Callaway said. We have faith in our other guys.The rest of the relievers, though, have been underwhelming. Seth Lugo has surrendered six runs in 10 and two-thirds innings. Familia has two wins despite a 6.84 E.R.A. Gsellman had already blown a save before walking in the run against the Phillies.On Monday, righty Drew Gagnon was recalled from Syracuse. Were kind of strapped for pitching, Callaway said.Three Mets  McNeil, Pete Alonso and Ramos  are ranked in the top 10 of the National League for batting average. While McNeil (.404) continues to make contact with almost anything thrown his way, Alonso (.339) has quickly established himself as much more than just a long-ball threat, though he does have six home runs already. The steady stroke of Ramos (.320) has kept the order moving on multiple occasions.Nimmo received a wake-up call when he was dropped in the lineup from leadoff to eighth on Friday, and he responded by going 3 for 4 with a homer and a double. He has continued to hit since.Cano had struggled since homering and driving in an insurance run on opening day. Heading into Monday nights game, he was 3 for his last 24 and batting .183 on the year, but he doubled in the top of the fourth inning against the Phillies to drive in two runs.Hell be fine, Callaway said.When Todd Frazier and Jed Lowrie went down with injuries early in camp, the Mets knew they had bodies to fill in  they just didnt know how well those bodies would perform.Dominic Smith has adjusted to his bench role very well, both as a late-inning defensive replacement for Alonso at first base and as a pinch-hitter. He is batting .421.J.D. Davis, who has played at third, provided power with his two-homer game against the Washington Nationals at home on April 6 and with another shot in Atlanta on Sunday night. He has started to take fly balls in left field in order to get comfortable there for possible assignments.While the teams versatility is evident and depth concerns have been addressed, Callaway and company know it is time for the established stars  like deGrom, Cano and Syndergaard  to perform the way they are expected to in order to compete for the N.L. East title.AdvertisementWeekend Sports: West Ks 12 at Cost FieldRedshirt junior Derek West (46) struck out 12 Wake Forest batters in 6.0 frames.

By  Alexa Marzina, Staff Writer April 15, 2019While many of Pitts teams didnt earn their desired end result, the weekend still provided standout moments across Panther athletics, including a record-setting performance at Charles L. Cost field and the final regular-season match played by Pitts tennis team. Elsewhere, the track and field team saw several of its athletes reach the podium while softball suffered another sweep at Georgia Tech.TrackPitts track team split up to cover some ground over the weekend, with some members heading down to Knoxville for the Tennessee Invitational from Thursday to Saturday while others went to Bucknell University for the Bison Outdoor Classic, which ran from Saturday to Sunday. The Panthers managed to land several athletes on the podium at each location.First-years Crockett Schooler and Sydni Townsend led the Knoxville faction on Friday, with the former taking third in the mens 400-meter hurdles in 53.11 seconds and the latter taking second in the womens 400-meter hurdles with a time of 58.89  a new personal record and the fourth-fastest time in program history.At Bucknell, sophomore Daveon Finley led the Panthers with a gold-medal finish in the 110-meter hurdles, finishing in 14.74 seconds. Sophomore Greg Lauray also continued his standout season, claiming silver in the high jump with a 2.04-meter leap. Other contributors included senior Makenzie Zeh, who finished third in the womens mile with a 4:59.90, and fifth-year Nick Sloan, who set a season best and finished eighth in the mens 1,500-meter run with a 3:46.13.Next up, Pitts entire team will come together for the Virginia Challenge in Charlottesville, Virginia, running from Friday to Saturday.SoftballThe Panthers got swept on the road this weekend by Georgia Tech in a series of contests that didnt even see any seventh-inning action from the Yellow Jackets.Fridays affair stayed scoreless until the fourth inning, when sophomore Hunter Levesque nailed a leadoff hit to put Pitt on the board. Georgia answered in the fifth with five runs of its own  four being due to an infield error  and the Panthers couldnt recover, losing 5-2.Saturday saw a more competitive side of the Panthers early, earning one run each in four innings. First-year pitcher Abby Edwards earned four strikeouts in the first four innings before being replaced with senior Taylor Rahach, who notched one of her own.Even with Pitts consistent scoring, the Yellow Jackets overpowered the Panthers, gaining five points combined from the fifth and sixth innings, leading to a Pitt loss in the bottom of the sixth, 6-4. Ready for the comeback later that day, Pitt put up seven runs within the first two innings in its second game, promising for a big Panther win.But the Panthers went scoreless the rest of the game, while the Yellow Jackets earned six, five and five points in the fourth, fifth and sixth innings, respectively. Georgia Techs lead earned a mercy rule victory, 19-8, dropping the Panthers to 7-36 on the season.Pitt returns home to Vartabedian Field Tuesday at 5 p.m. to try to break its four-game losing streak, facing 18-20 Kent State.BaseballPitt baseball fared slightly better than softball but couldnt seal the deal against Wake Forest in its series this weekend, falling two games to one at home, slipping to 10-24 on the season. Redshirt junior pitcher Derek West was Friday nights star, earning 12 strikeouts in six innings, the highest of all Pitt pitchers this season and a tie for the record from any Pitt pitcher at Charles L. Cost Field. The Panthers offense got off to a hot start, making it a seven-point game by the end of the fifth, including two RBIs each from sophomore Ron Washington Jr., senior Connor Perry and junior Nico Popa.The Demon Deacons tried to make the comeback, earning three runs combined in the sixth and seventh innings, but couldnt put anything else up on the board, ending the contest in Pitts favor, 8-3. But the next day didnt fare as well for the Panthers, as they lost both games in their doubleheader.Pitt started off solid in the first game by gaining a 3-0 lead by the second inning, but Wake Forest answered with four runs in the fourth, gaining the advantage and keeping it through the duration of the game while all the Panthers could do was chip away at the deficit, ending the afternoon with a 20-8 loss.Using that momentum, Wake Forest led the second game of the day with a six-run second inning and keeping the Panthers low on the scoring front. Pitt seemed to be coming back in the sixth, with a two-run double from sophomore Bryce OFarrell, but it wasnt enough as Pitt fell again, 7-6.The Panthers have the opportunity to avenge their recent home losses with another contest at Charles L. Cost Field against Youngstown State Tuesday at 3 p.m.TennisIn its final scheduled regular-season game in program history, Pitt womens tennis dropped to 0-14 against conference opponents and 4-17 overall, having not won a contest since Feb. 16. The No. 22 Demon Deacons bested the Panthers at Wake Forest Tennis Complex Sunday, 4-1.Pitt only earned one win each in singles and doubles competition. Senior Clara Lucas and sophomore Camila Moreno snagged a doubles victory, besting Wake Forests Anna Ulyashchenko and Joanna Zalewski, 6-3. Singles competitor senior Natsumi Okamoto got the best of Anna Brylin in their first contest, 6-2, and earned the win after Brylin retired during the second game.The Panthers start their postseason Wednesday against Notre Dame in the ACC Championships in Cary, North Carolina, at 2:30 p.m.Tags: baseball, derek west, marzina, softball, tennis, track, weekend sportsAlexa is a senior pursuing an English writing degree and a certificate in American Sign Language.

The worms were found in Central Florida, more than 100 miles away from where Burmese pythons have been reported in the southern part of the state.Even though the worms were found in the northern part of the state, that doesn't mean there are pythons there, according to a recent study. Researchers say the parasites traveled so far by hitching riders in reptiles and other host animals that Florida snakes eat. Officials say there is a risk of the worms spreading to other states."At this point, they are moving very rapidly. They are certainly in Brevard County," said Terence Farrell, a biologist at Stetson University. "It's conceivable they will spread throughout the whole United States."While dissecting three pygmy rattlesnakes, researches found the parasites in the lungs and tracheas of the animals. One of the worms was reportedly as wide as the snake's trachea and could have obstructed the snake's airway.Researchers say the bloodsucking parades aren't thought to be a health risk to humans.These findings were published in the Herpetological Review.Editors note: Fourth in a series of 10 personality stories on the top 10 academic students in the Loudonville High School Class of 2019. Sports. The outdoors. A big family. Great grades. All of these factors influenced Joe Henley in his formative years growing up in Loudonville. However, Henley, one of the top 10 academic students in this years senior class with a 3.88 academic average, has chosen business as his career field as he takes his next step, going to college at the University of Akron. "I worked the past two summers at the Go Karts at Mohican Adventures, and I found, on the job, that I really enjoyed dealing with people," he said. "I think I would be happy and successful in a business career that centers on dealing with people." His summer job at Mohican Adventures also influenced his college choice. "A couple of guys I worked with go there and told me the programs there are awesome, and I confirmed that in my studies of various college. Akron has an outstanding business program." Henleys favorite subjects at LHS were the biological sciences. "I really enjoyed Mr. David Sprengs Biology II class because of the outdoor work we did in it, like taxonomy," he said. "In fact, I have always enjoyed doing things outdoors." He also loves sports. At LHS, Henley has earned four letters in basketball and baseball, three in soccer, and one in football, and commented, "of the sports, I think I like basketball the best, even though I am not as good at it as baseball." Henley also grew up in a big family, as the fifth of six children of Chuck and Rita Henley of Loudonville. His eldest sister, Lauren Davis, 34, is a teacher in Columbus; Twila Soles, 33, who lives in Colorado and is a craft beer brewer; Will, 22, also in Columbus where he drives truck for Amazon; Liz, 20, who recently graduated from college at the Bradford School in Columbus; and James, 14, an eighth-grader. Asked if any individual had a major influence on his life, he immediately mentioned his older brother Will. "We were very close when we were younger, and he taught me to play, and enjoy, all sports," he said. At LHS, he cited social studies teacher Eric Stoner as the most influential. "I took a college level politics class from him, and learned a lot about politics and government, and in the process, he shared a lot of knowledge and experience about a lot of other subjects," Henley said. Last year, as a junior, he took four College Credit Plus courses, two math and two social studies, but this year he is sticking just with LHS classes. "Among them this year are calculus and physics, both pretty tough classes," he said. In addition to all the sports, Henley is a member of the high schools Leo Club and the National Honor Society. He was captain of the basketball team this year, and is a member of St. Peter Catholic Church.

Ad Choices  RALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTo read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.Apps: Apple Podcasts |

ESPN Seattle's Stacy Jo Rost, via Twitter, after Edwin Encarnacion became the first Mariner since 2002 to hit two homers in the same inning: "This was 17 'Spiderman' remakes ago."BOSTON (AP)  Chris Davis knows his homer went a lot further than teammate Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-run shot. He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot  estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's  projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name  'Crush'  for a reason."Renato Nez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vzquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velzquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vzquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vzquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsTo read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.Apps: Apple Podcasts |

Citigroup slipped after its own earnings report. Banks are leading off an earnings-reporting season that analysts expect to be the weakest in nearly three years.The S&P 500 slipped 1.83 points, or 0.1%, to 2,905.58. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 27.53 points, or 0.1%, to 26,384.77, and the Nasdaq composite edged down 8.15 points, or 0.1%, to 7,976.01. The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks fell 5.63, or 0.4%, to 1,579.17.The S&P 500 is still within 0.9% of the record high it set in September. It has had a torrid start to the year after the Federal Reserve said it may not raise interest rates at all in 2019.I think were going to see equities continue to confound their critics and advance, said Margie Patel, senior portfolio manager at Wells Fargo Asset Management.She expects growth for both the economy and corporate earnings to re-accelerate later this year, in large part because of the Federal Reserves pledge to hit pause on interest-rate hikes. That follows seven interest-rate increases in the last two years, including the last one in December, that raised worries about a possible recession and helped send the S&P 500 to a nearly 20% loss at one point.If you look through history, recessions have been precipitated by the Federal Reserve tightening and causing recessions  telling banks, Dont make loans, and pulling out liquidity, she said. This time, they got right up to the brink, and when the market had that violent reaction in December, that made them rethink their approach.Optimism has also grown that the United States and China can resolve their trade dispute. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Saturday that the worlds two largest economies were moving closer to an agreement.Some of the markets biggest losses Monday came from the financial sector. Lighter trading activity during the first three months of the year meant that Goldman Sachs revenue fell short of analysts estimates. Its shares slid 3.8%.Like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup also reported stronger first-quarter profit than analysts expected. Its stock slipped 0.1%.Alliance Data Systems sank 9.3%, the largest loss in the S&P 500, after it agreed to sell its Epsilon business to Publicis Groupe for $4.4 billion in cash. That price was less than what some analysts had valued the business at.On the winning side was Waste Management, which jumped 2.4% after it agreed to buy its smaller rival, Advanced Disposal, for $3 billion. It will also assume $1.9 billion of debt in the deal. Advanced Disposal surged 17.9%.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.55%. It has been climbing since late last month, when it fell to 2.37% amid a crescendo of worries that global economic growth was slowing.In the commodities markets, the price of oil gave back some of its big gains for the year. Benchmark U.S. crude oil fell 49 cents to settle at $63.40. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 37 cents to $71.18. Both remain up more than 30% for the year.Natural gas slipped 7 cents to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet. Heating oil slipped a penny to $2.06 a gallon. Wholesale gasoline fell 3 cents to $2.01 a gallon.Gold fell $3.90 to $1,291.30 an ounce. Silver rose 1 cent to $14.98 an ounce. Copper slipped 1 cent to $2.94 a pound.The dollar fell to 112.03 yen from 112.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1304 from $1.1296. The British pound rose to $1.0041 from $1.0029.By Nate RaymondBOSTON (Reuters) - Actress Lori Loughlin on Monday entered a not guilty plea to charges that she participated in a wide-ranging college admissions scam by paying bribes to get her two daughters admitted to the University of Southern California.Loughlin, who starred in the television sitcom "Full House," and her fashion designer husband Mossimo Giannulli filed papers in federal court in Boston waiving their personal appearances at an arraignment hearing and asking to have not guilty pleas entered on their behalf.They are among 50 people accused of participating in a massive scheme that allowed wealthy parents to use cheating and $25 million in bribes to help their children secure spots at well-known universities like Yale, Georgetown and USC.California college admissions consultant William "Rick" Singer pleaded guilty in March to charges that helped parents facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and bribed coaches at universities to falsely present their children as athletic recruits.Prosecutors allege that Loughlin, 54, and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 to have their two daughters named as recruits to USC's crew team, even though they did not row competitively, to help them gain admission.Loughlin and Giannulli provided Singer photographs of their daughters in order to create fake athletic profiles for them, which a USC athletics official in exchange for bribes then used to support recruiting them, prosecutors said.The couple and several other parents were originally charged in March with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. Prosecutors secured an indictment on April 9 that included an additional charge of conspiring to commit money laundering.Several other parents charged alongside Loughlin and Giannulli also filed papers seeking to waive appearing at an arraignment and have not guilty pleas entered for them. A federal magistrate judge granted their requests on Monday.In all, 33 parents have been charged in the college admissions scandal. Of those, 13 have agreed to plead guilty, including "Desperate Housewives" TV star Felicity Huffman. She is scheduled to plead guilty on May 21.(Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Tom Brown)(Reuters) - The man accused of seriously injuring a 5-year-old boy by throwing him from a balcony at Minnesota's Mall of America last week told investigators he had initially intended to kill an adult, but it did not "work out," prosecutors said on Monday.Emmanuel Aranda, who police said has a history of mental issues and arrests on relatively minor charges, went to the mall last Thursday and left without following through on his plan, the Hennepin County Attorney's office said in a statement.He returned on Friday when he picked the boy and threw him from the building's third tier, it said.Police have not identified the boy, but said he suffered life-threatening injuries after falling nearly 40 feet (12 meters) at the Bloomington mall, a major tourist attraction in the state.In a GoFundMe post that has so far raised more than $570,000 for the child's medical expenses, a friend of the family identified as Noah Hanneman ofWoodbury, Minnesota, said on Sunday that the boy, whom he identified by his first name Landon, was still fighting for his life."He had a peaceful sleep and is still continuing to fight his courageous battle," Hanneman said. "He's a strong survivor!"Aranda, 24, of Minneapolis, will face attempted premeditated first-degree murder charges when he makes his first court appearance on Tuesday, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said in a statement. Prosecutors will ask that bail be set at $2 million, Freeman said."That a child, with his mother, at a safe public area like a mall, could be violently attacked for no reason is chilling for everyone," Freeman said. "We charged Mr. Aranda with the most severe crime that the evidence allowed."Aranda told investigators that he knew what he was planning to do was wrong, prosecutors said in the complaint. They said he lashed out aggressively after years of coming to the mall to try to speak with women and being rejected.After throwing the boy from the balcony, Aranda fled the scene but was arrested elsewhere at the mall a short time later, Bloomington Police Chief Jeff Potts said on Friday. [nL1N21U1UO]Aranda had been arrested by Bloomington police three times in 2015, including once after he threw an object from the third level at the mall, Potts told reporters on Saturday.Some of Aranda's previous arrests were heard in mental health court, Potts added.(Reporting by Peter Szekely in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)Published: April 15, 2019 Updated: April 15, 2019 3:47 PM EDT Filed Under:As the Ottawa 67s await the start of the third round of the OHL playoffs  they will open the series at The Arena at TD Place Thursday and Saturday  theyve been busy signing key pieces of the future.The 67s announced the signings of top draft picks Jack Matier, Jack Beck and Brenden Sirizzotti.Matier, a 6-2, 174-pound defenceman chosen 21st overall in the OHL draft, scored 10 goals and 11 assists in 21 games with the minor midget Soo Thunderbirds in 2018-19.Beck, a left winger, netted 33 goals and 41 assists in 73 games with the minor midget Toronto Marlboros this season.Sirizzotti registered 32 goals and 61 assists in 32 games with the Whitby Wildcats in 2018-19.As for the current playoff run, the 67s will play the winner of the Oshawa-Niagara series.

For Senators fans, their success is a bit like pouring salt into the wound of painful trades.

Pittsburgh Penguins Phil Kessel (81) cannot get a shot past New York Islanders goaltender Robin Lehner (40) with Islanders Ryan Pulock (6) also defending during the second period in Game 3 of an NHL first-round hockey playoff series in Pittsburgh, Sunday, April 14, 2019.

Lehner, once upon a time deemed the Senators goaltender of the future, has backstopped his New York Islanders to a commanding 3-0 series lead over the Pittsburgh Penguins.Duchene, who originally came to the Senators in the hopes of realizing his wish of an extended playoff run, has become the offensive leader for a Columbus Blue Jackets team on the verge of knocking out the Tampa Bay Lightning in what could go down as one of the most colossal upsets in NHL history.Stone, meanwhile, went into Mondays action atop the NHL playoff scoring race, fresh from the first hat trick of his career  thats right, he never scored one during his stellar career in Ottawa  in giving his Vegas Golden Knights a 2-1 series lead over the San Jose Sharks.

The Golden Knights defeated the Sharks 6-3 to take a 2-1 lead in the series.

In the big picture of the sporting world, of course, it was Tigers weekend; a remarkable comeback to the top of the golfing world.Yet just as the Woods celebration was calming down late in the afternoon, Lehner was being heralded for yet another stellar performance in the Islanders net, stopping 25 of 26 shots. Lehner owns a 1.62 goals against average, with a .951 save percentage.For those who forget the history, Lehner lost his spot in the Senators organizational depth chart in 2015, sitting out with a concussion during the remarkable Hamburglar run.He was then traded to the Buffalo Sabres, along with David Legwand and his contract, for the first-round draft pick that eventually became current centre Colin White.

Signed as a free agent by the Islanders last summer, Lehners personal recovery from addiction to booze and pills, a bipolar disorder and suicidal thoughts, had made him the leading candidate to win the Bill Masterton Trophy.Now, hes pouring playoff gravy on all of that. Before the current post-season run, Lehner had only 49 minutes of NHL playoff experience, mop-up duty in a series against the Penguins while with the Senators in 2013.If the Islanders 3-0 edge on the Penguins can be considered a major surprise, the Duchene-led Blue Jackets advantage on the Lightning is akin to David taking down Goliath.

Only 1:44 into Sundays game, Duchene scored to set off the infamous Columbus cannon, setting the tone for what became a 3-1 victory and the commanding 3-0 series lead. Duchene leads the Blue Jackets in playoff scoring, with two goals and three assists.Playoff success is what Duchene hoped for when the Senators made the colossal deal to acquire him in 2017.As difficult as it is for Senators fans to watch, there is a potential silver lining. Should an extended Blue Jackets playoff run  theyve yet to win a single post-season series since joining the NHL in 2000  lead to Duchene signing a long-term contract extension, the Senators will receive an additional first round draft pick in 2020. In the original trade deadline deal, the Senators also received the Blue Jackets 2019 first-round pick, along with prospects Vitaly Abramov and Jonathan Davidson.

As Duchene and company were basking in the Sunday victory, Stone was just getting started in Vegas.A mere 16 seconds into Game 3, Stone opened the scoring with a breakaway backhand goal over the shoulder of Sharks goaltender Martin Jones.He finished off the Sharks with a pair of third period goals, along with a pair of second period assists, to complete a five-point night. For those not still awake as Sunday turned to Monday, the wild Stone jubilation would have seemed familiar to Senators fans who have seen his emotional outbursts in the past.

The Senators also received a 2020 second-round draft pick and centre Oscar Lindberg, who had a strong finish to the regular season in Ottawa, but likely isnt going to re-sign here in the summer.Thats the future the Senators have to bank on from losing Stone.For now, though, Stone has six goals and two assists in three games, his name and photo front and centre where NHL.com lists its statistical leaders. The line of Stone, Max Pacioretty and Paul Stastny, who all came from elsewhere this season, has combined for 10 goals and 12 assists in a mere three games.

If its any consolation to Senators fans, its that all three of Stones goals came with former Senators captain Erik Karlsson on the ice, unable to contain him and the rest of the Golden Knights.Karlsson has five points in three games and is tied with Winnipegs Dustin Byfuglien for the playoff scoring lead among defencemen, but Karlsson and the Sharks have struggled defensively.Seemingly, everywhere you look in the NHL playoffs, theres a Senators connection somewhere.kwarren@postmedia.comTwitter: @CitizenwarrenALSO IN THE NEWSAfter 48 years and over 1,000 games, a rec-league hockey player joins the 500 clubVideo: Notre-Dame Cathedral on fireBack to the future as Redblacks hire Joe PaopaoWe encourage all readers to share their views on our articles and blog posts.

She died in December 2017, months before the third one would get underway. Lauren succumbed to rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of cancer that targets muscle, tendons, cartilage and bones.It's still surreal to think Lauren is gone, and we feel her absence every day, and so very strongly at Knots of Love, said Amy Graver, Laurens mother.This years community event was hosted March 15 at Prospect High School, where two of Laurens siblings attend. The school in Mt. Prospect is part of the Arlington Heights-based Township High School District 214.Participants were encouraged to bring materials such as fleece to assemble blankets, and Amy Graver said that some 580 blankets were made. She said she got over 100 more after the event at the school.In total, more than 700 Knots of Love blankets were expected to be delivered this year by the Graver family to the pediatric cancer unit at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, the mother said.She said kids having surgeries and kids with overnight or long term hospital stays would receive a blanket. They would be distributed to patients from 1 year old to 18.Its really cool to see how many people support our family and want to make blankets in honor of Lauren, said Claire Graver, a freshman at Prospect High School and Laurens older sister.To continue to honor Laurens memory, the Graver family has created the Lauren Graver Memorial Scholarship, which aims to provide a minimum of $500 annually to a graduating Prospect High School senior who intends to pursue a career in journalism.Amy Graver said that, starting this year, the family sold T-shirts to fund the scholarship. Laurens brother Connor and sister Claire designed the shirts.We are thrilled we have another avenue to continue Lauren's legacy of kindness, she said.The award is meant for a student who has demonstrated leadership and hard work within the field of journalism at Prospect High School or with its school news outlet, The Prospector.Every year were surprised more and more with how many people come out and how many people care about our family, said Connor Graver, a senior at Prospect High School.The schools Guitar Club sponsors Knots of Love.We have a goal here of being more involved in service and of getting the community involved, said Dr. Jay Kyp-Johnson, the schools psychologist and sponsor of the Guitar Club.Amy Graver said she and her family remain grateful for the outpouring of support.We look back at her interview from the second year when she said she wants blankets so she can make other kids feel at home as she did, Amy Graver said of Lauren. That's why we continue this. Lauren wanted to be the sick kid that helped other sick kids.Kyra Senese is a freelancer.

El obispo auxiliar y rector de la Universidad Catlica de Santo Domingo, monseor Jess Castro Marte, consider que muchos cristianos, incluido sacerdotes, no han entendido el mensaje de Jess en la cruz y fruto de sus debilidades humanas lo han traicionado, pero que el papel de la Iglesia catlica es recordarles que hay que volver a las races.Indic que esta Semana Santa y siempre se mantiene el llamado constante de volver a Cristo, que fue humillado y maltratado. Critic a los cristianos que solo buscan prestigio, poder y grandeza contraria a Jesucristo que rechaz todo eso y aunque padeci en la cruz tena la certeza de que no se quedara en el sufrimiento.Hay miles de personas que son creyentes, que van constantemente al tempo, inclusive, consagrados sacerdotes que a veces traicionan su vocacin sacerdotal. Por ejemplo, todo el problema que est sufriendo la Iglesia, y que le ha dolido fuertemente como el problema de la pedofilia, gente consagrada, gente que deca que creer en Jesucristo, pero han cado en esa enfermedad humana que ha escandalizado, ellos estn negando el gran mensaje de salvacin de Cristo, estn traicionado el mansaje de Jesucristo que es amar al inocente, al ser humano, sostuvo.Record que hoy existen muchos de los personajes de la poca de Jesucristo, como Pedro que neg al maestro, sacerdote que van haciendo fraudes econmicos en la iglesia...cuanta vuelta ha dado el sentido de la banca de Roma cambiando gente, hay fragilidades humanas, pero no es el modelo ni el pensamiento de Dios es la parte humana la que falla. El tambin obispo auxiliar de la Arquidicesis de Santo Domingo al participar en el Dilogo Libre, dijo que pese a ello la Iglesia, tal y como lo ha pedido el papa Francisco, sale de s misma, de su entorno, para ir a la periferia, al encuentro con el hermano necesitado.La iglesia dominicana siempre ha permanecido en la periferia, cuntas parroquias nosotros tenemos en lugares pobres, por ejemplo, todo el rio Ozama, Capotillo Isabela, Santo Domingo Norte y Monte Plata, hay una gran presencia de muchos sacerdotes y religiosas entregados por el evangelio, es un mandato de Jesucristo que lo dice claro: los pobres siempre estarn conmigo y la Iglesia nunca puede traicionar ese mensaje de Jesucristo de brindar a los pobres todo el apoyo humano y espiritual.Precis que, a travs del proceso de llevar el evangelio a la periferia, la gente va acogiendo la palabra de Dios e insisti en que no se puede traicionar nunca el mensaje de Jesucristo a los ms pobres, a los ms marginados.Monseor Castro Marte asegur que hoy da las personas y los pueblos estn crucificados porque existe sufrimiento, hambre, desnudez, rechazo, explotacin y otras realidades de muerte que existen en el mundo que se traducen en la prolongacin de muere de Cristo en la cruz.Sin embargo, precis que por eso el cristiano conmemora siempre la cuaresma y la pascua porque nunca un cristiano se quedar en el sufrimiento porque ese grito llega hasta Dios.Afirm que la Semana Santa es una vivencia, que no se puede ver como un recuerdo, que lo ms importante es la vivencia espiritual que no debe quedarse en la cruz, en el pecado, en la confusin interna, porque Cristo ha resucitado y eso debe ser de plena alegra para todos los cristianos.Hacemos un llamado especial al pueblo dominicano para que trate de vivir con profundidad estos das santos, pensando en que Cristo muri en la cruz, su padecimiento y sufrimiento no se qued en la cruz, en el madero, sino que resucit, as tambin debe ser nuestra vida, resucitar constantemente, sostuvo.SANTO DOMINGO. Monseor Castro Marte inform que en la Arquidicesis de Santo Domingo estn muy satisfechos con las vocaciones y revel que en la actualidad unos 70 seminaristas se estn formando para ser sacerdotes.Aclar que, aunque el mundo ha cambiado, al igual que el aspecto religioso por las facilidades y la afluencia que tienen los jvenes a travs de los medios de dominacin y los malos ejemplos de muchos religiosos, por encima de eso estn surgiendo vocaciones.Nosotros vocacionalmente en la arquidicesis de Santo Domingo nos sentimos orgullos y satisfechos con las vocaciones.Nosotros vocacionalmente en la arquidicesis de Santo Domingo nos sentimos orgullos y satisfechos con las vocaciones. Destac que se ha cambiado el sistema de la formacin de los sacerdotes y puso de ejemplo que en Santiago el seminario Santo Tomas de Aquino, los seminaristas van durante el da a estudiar a la Universidad Catlica Madre y Maestra y luego regresan al seminario donde reciben capacitacin a parte de participar en actividades como misa, rosario, y otras.Sobre la vida del obispo que se retiran, dijo que ellos permanecen en una vida activa con retiros, orientaciones, van a seminarios y algunos hasta estn encargados de parroquia y viven en paz en una residencia sacerdotal.Nunca uno se retira, solo en la tumba. Ellos se retiran del concepto cannico, pero su vida sacerdotal est en constante actividad y la gente los va a visitar, dijo.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

El Brexit y el debate sobre la independencia de Escocia son inseparables desde 2016, segn los expertos, que, en un momento arriesgado para los pronsticos polticos, coinciden en que tanto una salida abrupta de la Unin Europea (UE) como una negociada marcarn los pasos del secesionismo.En 2014, el 55 % de los escoceses rechaz la separacin en un referndum pactado con el Gobierno britnico, tras el que se asumi que la cuestin quedaba zanjada para al menos una generacin.Dos aos ms tarde, la victoria del brexit o salida de la UE (que cont con el voto en contra del 62 % de escoceses) puso patas arriba este argumento y prcticamente desde que se conocieron los resultados que dejaran al pas fuera del bloque comn, la ministra principal escocesa, Nicola Sturgeon, anunci su intencin de volver a las urnas.Para los expertos, el hecho de abandonar la UE se consider en 2014 como uno de los argumentos que hizo a los indecisos decantarse por mantenerse dentro del Reino Unido a riesgo de perder los beneficios del mercado comn y la unin aduanera, que ahora desaparecern si triunfa el acuerdo que busca el Gobierno britnico.Con vistas al 31 de octubre prximo, la nueva fecha del brexit, Anthony Salamone, analista del Centro Escocs de Relaciones Europeas, y Aileen McHarg, profesora de Derecho de la Universidad Strathclyde de Glasgow, desgranan para Efe cmo los distintos escenarios de la ruptura pueden condicionar la hoja de ruta del independentismo.Los sondeos muestran que, desde la victoria del brexit, el respaldo a la independencia oscila entre el 43 % y el 47 %, una cifra similar al 45 % que la apoy en la consulta de 2014.Salamone seal que el Partido Nacionalista Escocs (SNP), que lidera Sturgeon, no quera tener de nuevo el debate sobre un segundo referndum de independencia hasta que las encuestas mostraran una mayora clara.La nica razn por la que lo estn alimentando es porque el brexit ha forzado el calendario, indic.Si finalmente el Reino Unido abandona la UE de forma negociada y adems se mantiene en el mercado comn y/o la unin aduanera, Salamone opina que la mayora de escoceses puede que se sienta ms cmodo y no quiera separarse del Reino Unido.Sin embargo, un escenario acordado que mitigue los efectos de la salida puede ocasionar, de acuerdo con McHarg, que los ciudadanos perciban ms fcilmente cuales son las cuestiones prcticas que se plantearan al romper con el Reino Unido y que el temor a cambiar el sistema constitucional actual sea menor.Ambos analistas coinciden en que las encuestan pronostican que un escenario de este tipo har aumentar significativamente el sentimiento independentista, ya que adems las previsiones econmicas prevn una cada del PIB en Escocia de hasta el 9 %.Si no hay acuerdo, las encuestas sugieren que puede haber una mayora en favor de la independencia. Si, por ejemplo, hay un acuerdo que termine con la libre circulacin de personas, la opinin de muchos puede cambiar, porque Escocia, no solo est en favor de la libre circulacin, sino que la necesita, explic Salamone.McHarg matiz, no obstante, que un brexit catico conducira tambin a que parte de los ciudadanos teman romper con una unin forjada durante tantos aos.Tras el receso parlamentario de Pascua, Sturgeon se ha comprometido a revelar cules son sus planes en relacin a la posible convocatoria de una nueva consulta. Para volver a las urnas, es necesario que el Gobierno escocs reciba el permiso del britnico y poder legislar as al respecto.McHarg y Salamone consideran que la ministra principal no cesar en su empeo de celebrar una segunda consulta (acuciada adems por la presin de las bases y parte de los miembros del SNP que querran una consulta lo antes posible), pero creen que el anuncio ser vago en cuanto a los plazos.Lo que creo es que Sturgeon no va a abandonar la idea de un segundo referndum, la cuestin es si fijar un calendario especfico o si ser ms general, afirm Salamone, que apunt la posibilidad de que el SNP, primero en las encuestas, espere hasta despus de las prximas elecciones regionales de 2021.La incertidumbre que arrastra inexorablemente el brexit es, para la profesora McHarg, la baza con la que juega la lder independentista, dado que le evita tener que forzar esta cuestin, porque la ltima vez que lo hizo, en las elecciones generales de 2017, no le fue muy bien (el SNP perdi 21 escaos).Hay un beneficio en la incertidumbre que genera el brexit, porque mantiene el debate independentista abierto, pero sin forzarlo a una conclusin que puede ser la que no quieren, dijo.

Una mujer blanca que promocionaba su restaurante en la ciudad de Nueva York por ofrecer una comida limpia de inspiracin china se ha vuelto la restaurantera ms reciente en ser acusada de abusar de los estereotipos gastronmicos y de la apropiacin cultural.La propietaria del restaurante Lucky Lees tambin se burl de los platos chinos diciendo que nadan en trozos de mantequilla procesada , sodio y glutamato monosdico.Llovieron las crticas en lnea contra el restaurante, alegando que su manera de promoverse se bas en prejuicios cansados y racistas de que la comida china es antihiginica o grotesca.El caso del comedor, que se inaugur das atrs en Greenwich Village, reaviv el debate en Estados Unidos sobre cmo los chefs deben manejar la gastronoma de una cultura que no es la suya.Arielle Haspel, que es blanca y una instructora certificada de salud, dijo al sitio web de restaurantes Eater que ella quera ofrecer versiones modificadas y limpias de los platos tpicos chinos. En un mensaje en Instagram, Haspel dijo que un plato de fideos chinos, lo mein, puede hacer que la gente se sienta inflada y apestosa.Los crticos en lnea se abalanzaron contra Haspel, entre ellos el escritor neoyorquino Eddie Huang, quien descalific la comida de Lucky Lees como el Fyre Fest de la comida y el bienestar, en la pgina del restaurante en Instagram.Fyre Fest alude al fallido Festival Fyre, que supuestamente iba a ofrecer alimentos, msica y hospedaje de lujo en el segundo trimestre de 2017 en una isla bahamea. En lugar de villas lujosas y comidas gourmet, los asistentes al festival recibieron sndwiches preempacados y tiendas de campaa como alojamiento.Haspel se disculp posteriormente, pero sus comentarios constituyen el error ms reciente de varios restauranteros y chefs de televisin que han sido criticados por su insensibilidad al lidiar con la comida de una cultura que no es la suya propia.Robert Ku, profesor de estudios asitico-estadounidenses en la Universidad de Binghampton, Nueva York, dijo que Haspel pareca repetir los viejos estereotipos sobre la falta de higiene o lo grotesco de la cocina china. Fue una falta de consideracin particular en Nueva York, donde muchos consumen comida china de manera habitual.Son metforas gastadas que se han adherido a la cocina china ms que a cualquier otra, dijo Ku, autor de trabajos sobre la poltica cultural de la cocina asitica en Estados Unidos. Su enfoque es el de la salud y la higiene, lo cual implica que los otros no lo son.Aadi que es un mito que los restaurantes chinos en Estados Unidos usen glutamato monosdico. La mayora lo eliminaron de sus cocinas en la dcada de 1970.Haspel ofreci disculpas en una entrevista el viernes con el New York Times. Previamente haba reconocido la indignacin a travs de Instagram y prometido escuchar y reflexionar sobre la reaccin de la gente. No respondi a los pedidos de declaraciones de la AP.Tambin han sido fustigados chefs blancos como Andrew Zimmern y Gordon Ramsay por sus respectivos restaurantes asiticos, que incluyen en sus nombres el adjetivo lucky (afortunado). Esa palabra es un estereotipo en los restaurantes de comida asitica en pases angloparlantes.Zimmern dijo en una entrevista el ao pasado que su restaurante Lucky Cricket en Minnesota salvaba las almas de la gente que come en restaurantes (grosera) que se hacen pasar por cocina china en la regin. Posteriormente ofreci disculpas.El britnico Ramsay inaugurar su restaurante Lucky Cat, de inspiracin japonesa, en Londres a mediados de ao. Dijo en un comunicado de prensa en febrero que su restaurante sera revolucionario y autntico, pero muchos advirtieron la ausencia de asiticos en los puestos ejecutivos clave de la empresa.Por el otro lado, algunos chefs han ganado fama de visionarios por la mezcla de cocinas. Roy Choi elev la categora de los puestos callejeros con su Kogi BBQ en Los ngeles en 2008. Choi combin sus races coreanas con las tortillas para crear bocadillos deliciosos como tacos de costillas a la coreana.Oponerse a la apropiacin cultural no significa necesariamente a que alguien cocine por fuera de su propio grupo tnico o cultural, dijo el profesor Ku, pero el lmite suele ser borroso entre apropiacin y apreciacin.La gente reacciona contra el concepto de que durante generaciones, los chinos en Estados Unidos hicieron cosas, pero horriblemente mal. Como persona blanca, yo puedo hacerlo mejor, dijo Ku.El restaurantero neoyorquino Stratis Morfogen, de ascendencia griega, no se preocupa por las acusaciones de apropiacin cultural contra su casa de asados por sus productos de inspiracin china.Brooklyn Chop House, que abri sus puertas el otoo pasado, ofrece hamburguesas con queso, pastrami y sopa de cebolla francesa con albndigas chinas. Morfogen est colaborando con la cantante Patti LaBelle para llevar ese ltimo guiso a los pasillos de alimentos congelados de los supermercados, envasado en vaporizadores de bamb reutilizables.Si la gente no avanzara, no innovara o no creara y fusionara diferentes culturas, el paisaje culinario sera bastante aburrido, coment Morfogen.Morfogen da empleo a ms de 15 chefs chinos en sus restaurantes y uno de sus socios es un chef chino. Cree que los dueos de restaurantes preocupados por caer en estereotipos de manera inadvertida slo tienen que pensarlo dos veces antes de hablar.Realmente creo que esas palabras son insensibles y lastiman a la gente, apunt Morfogen. No creo que eso sea lo que la comida debe ser. Creo que la comida es para unir a todas las culturas y respetarse mutuamente.Descarga nuestras aplicaciones para Android y iOS.

For ages people have said that the simple act of smiling can boost one's mood  and alternatively, that frowning can make one feel down  but psychologists have long disagreed about whether facial expressions can lead to the emotions related to those expressions.Now a team of researchers from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and Texas A&M have co-authored a paper taking a deeper look at the question. In their research, they looked at nearly 50 years of data testing and found that, yes, smiling really can make people feel happier. A little bit, at least.In their meta-analysis, Coles and his team looked at data from 138 studies including more than 11,000 participants from across the globe."Some studies have not found evidence that facial expressions can influence emotional feelings," Coles said. "But we can't focus on the results of any one study. Psychologists have been testing this idea since the early 1970s, so we wanted to look at all the evidence."After crunching the numbers, they concluded that facial expressions do indeed have an impact on feelings. And it's not just smiling and happiness, they found that scowling makes people feel angrier and frowning makes them feel sadder.Alas, the impact doesn't appear to be dramatic. As described in the paper, "the overall effect of facial feedback was significant but small.""We don't think that people can smile their way to happiness," Coles said. "But these findings are exciting because they provide a clue about how the mind and the body interact to shape our conscious experience of emotion. We still have a lot to learn about these facial feedback effects, but this meta-analysis put us a little closer to understanding how emotions work."But hey, as far as I'm concerned, any little push towards happiness could come in handy. As Thich Nhat Hanh has said, Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.The study, "A Meta-Analysis of the Facial Feedback Literature: Effects of Facial Feedback on Emotional Experience Are Small and Variable," was published in Psychological Bulletin.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.Two weeks of climate action are starting on April 15.You wouldn't know it in North America, but it's a big day for climate protests. It's the start of two weeks of direct action by Extinction Rebellion. "This is not a one-off march  we will keep going for as long as we have to, shutting down cities day after day until our demands are met," the most significant being CARBON NET ZERO BY 2025  The Government must enact legally-binding policies to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025 and take further action to remove the excess of atmospheric greenhouse gases.Waterloo bridge transformed!

And yet, should it fail, the long-term costs of climate change will be immense for almost everybody now alive and for all our descendants, too.Theyve got music, trees, a skate ramp and free vegetarian food here on Waterloo Bridge - while police watch and traffic snarls up. Theres no telling how long @ExtinctionR plan to block the bridge for, or other central London locations like Oxford Circus @LBC pic.twitter.com/VyG08IYfvOThey are not wrong to focus on cars; the convenience of drivers and the price of gasoline seems to be a powerful political force. "The gilets jaunes movement in France started off in part as a protest against price rises on petrol; the Blair government sustained its first big defeat at the hands of lorry drivers in the fuel protests of 2000, which destroyed a sensible and ecologically necessary plan to raise fuel taxes steadily over time to discourage the use of fossil fuels." Doug Ford got elected in Ontario, Canada by promising lower fuel prices. But unfortunately, "a future of less consumption and less convenience is inevitable."Today April 15thSwedish Parliament right now#Swedish @ExtinctionR #ExtinctionRebellion pic.twitter.com/nMDTVG0tleThe protests are intended as the start of a global movement, as they must be. By themselves, they will accomplish little.

Do you want it? pic.twitter.com/vxdNmrky1IGeorge Monbiot is even more radical, writing that Only rebellion will prevent an ecological apocalypse, and suggesting that our whole economic system must change. (Listen to him in the tweet, and watch everyone's jaws drop.)Our system  characterised by perpetual economic growth on a planet that is not growing  will inevitably implode. The only question is whether the transformation is planned or unplanned. Our task is to ensure it is planned, and fast. We need to conceive and build a new system based on the principle that every generation, everywhere has an equal right to enjoy natural wealth.He's a fan of the Extinction Rebellion, concluding: "The time for excuses is over. The struggle to overthrow our life-denying system has begun.""The activists, known as Extinction Rebellion, occupied the House of Assembly for around an hour, telling stories of their grandchildren and the lives they believe will face them as a product of what they call a "climate catastrophe"." https://t.co/MxnmHpyW9L @ExtinctionRIt is so different in North America, where The New York Times devotes an entire magazine section to climate and cannot even get the very first sentence right:The worlds most difficult problem has a solution so simple that it can be expressed in four words: Stop burning greenhouse gases.Because they are either technically illiterate or they are simply afraid to say "stop burning fossil fuels." Then the most extreme statement they come up with is:The most fundamental question is whether a capitalistic society is capable of sharply reducing carbon emissions. Will a radical realignment of our economy require a radical realignment of our political system  within the next few years? Even if the answer is no, we have some decisions to make. How, for instance, should the proceeds of a carbon tax be directed? Should they be used to finance clean energy projects, be paid out directly to taxpayers or accrue to the national budget? In a healthy democracy, you could expect a rigorous public debate on this question.Today Denmark joins #ExtinctionRebellion in #InternationalRebellion.

It belongs to Ellen Bennett, a former professional chef and now kitchen-wear entrepreneur, who lives in Echo Park, Los Angeles.Bennett offers several great tips for organizing your home kitchen like a professional. These are tried-and-true methods for easier food storage, preparation, and serving that also make for a more attractive space.While you can read the entire tour in detail here, I took away the following points:Bennett has divided her kitchen tools into 4 categories: prep, cook, serve, store. All containers are stashed in drawers and cupboards according to their categorization.The same idea applies to flavors. Her fridge is divided into sections for Asian sauces, American sauces, pickled items, fruits and vegetable, and cheese.On the countertop, she keeps what she calls her flavor station, a reliable wooden bowl stocked with shallots, garlic and red onions. Theyre the raw materials, she says, the all-around the basics of good flavor.Come up with a simple system for labeling and stick with it. All you need is a roll of masking tape and a marker, or if you want to get fancy, chalkboard pen on black sticker labels. Label and date all refrigerator items, spice containers, frozen foods, pantry baskets. There will be less waste, as you won't have mysteriously unidentifiable foods kicking around.For those items that you use multiple times a day, keep them out on the counter and make them easily accessible. Get a magnetic knife strip. Have a basket near the stove with olive oil, salt, pepper, and butter. Leave a cutting board on the counter, a compost bin handy.It can be tempting to acquire specialized gadgets, but unless you use them on a regular basis, they're just taking up valuable real estate and contributing to a general sense of clutter.Counting a chefs knife, a paring knife, a bread knife and a pair of scissors as kitchen drawer essentials, [Bennett is] a staunch opponent of single-utility items like cherry pitters and garlic presses. Do not get an avocado slicer, she says. Learn to use a knife.Treat your pantry like your closet. It needs a major declutter and overhaul on a regular basis. Bennett recommends tossing (or donating) anything you haven't used within six months and keeping only those things that reflect your current cooking habits.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.Hubble's image of Messier 3 reveals what astronomers say is one of the prettiest "globular clusters" in the universe.In 1758, the chief astronomer of the Marine Observatory in Paris, Charles Messier, was observing a comet when he became distracted by a cloudy something in the constellation Taurus. Messier made a note of the object to help other comet hunters avoid becoming distracted by it. Commonly known today as M1 (Messier 1) or the Crab Nebula, it became the first object in Messiers Catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters, a listing of comet-like "objects to avoid."By the time of his death in 1817, Messier's list included 103 diffuse objects in the night sky that could be mistaken for comets. The catalog contains galaxies, planetary and other types of nebulae, and star clusters. Fast-forward two centuries and astronomers are working to make images of the catalog's objects with the help of the Hubble telescope. Why? Because as NASA notes, "the Messier catalog includes some of the most fascinating astronomical objects that can be observed from Earths Northern Hemisphere."The third such object on the list, Messier 3, is a globular cluster  as can be seen in the Hubble image above. The European Space Agency (ESA) notes:Globular clusters are inherently beautiful objects, but the subject of this NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image, Messier 3, is commonly acknowledged to be one of the most beautiful of them all.At 8 billion years old, this "cosmic bauble" includes an astonishing half-million stars, making it one of the largest and brightest globular clusters ever discovered."However, what makes Messier 3 extra special is its unusually large population of variable stars," writes ESA, "stars that fluctuate in brightness over time. New variable stars continue to be discovered in this sparkling stellar nest to this day, but so far we know of 274, the highest number found in any globular cluster by far."Aside from the abundance of variable stars, Messier 3 also plays home to a relatively high number of "blue stragglers," which can be seen in the image. "These are blue main sequence stars that appear to be young because they are bluer and more luminous than other stars in the cluster," notes ESA.While it took Hubble to reveal the details of this virtual storm of gemstones, many of the other objects in the Messier catalog are bright enough to be seen through a small telescope, making the catalog's illustrious items popular targets for amateur astronomers of all levels. What Mother Nature provides on our home planet is magical enough; that we can look to the heavens and see such wonders is the icing on the cake ... as well as a great reminder not to lose the nighttime sky.You can see Hubble's images of other objects listed by Messier here.Aaron Beard, Ap Sports WriterRALEIGH, N.C. (AP)  A diversity report released Monday on Major League Baseball finds the sport remaining largely on the same footing from the previous year in racial and gender hiring practices, with the biggest area of concern coming in the front offices of league teams.The annual report card from The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) at Central Florida found slight fluctuations in scores for racial and gender hiring. The grade for racial hiring was an A-minus with 89 points, up a point from a year earlier, while the grade for gender hiring dropped one point to a 70 for a C.The overall score was unchanged at 79, a B-minus.Richard Lapchick, the institute's director and the lead report author, has praised racial and gender hiring practices at the league's central office as the result of diversity initiatives directed by Renee Tirado, a league vice president serving as MLB's chief diversity and inclusion officer. The goal now, Lapchick said, is having that overall emphasis "filtered down to the teams in a strong way so that the pipeline is built in those teams.""Most of the senior positions are occupied by white men, and that's something that affects the game," he said. "It affects who's on the teams, it affects how they're perceived in the community."Young people are attuned to it, and if they're deciding to play a sport, and they see not very many people who look like them in Major League Baseball ... they're going to choose the other sports. And that's going to impact how many players are playing as well as all the other data in the report."The report relied primarily on data as of Dec. 31 that was collected by the MLB central office and provided to TIDES researchers.The league's central office received an A-plus for racial hiring and a C for gender hiring for the second straight year, though their scores dipped slightly. The league also received an overall A-plus for what the report called "impressive" diversity initiatives.But the report said team levels "remain far behind" the league's main office.Teams received a B for racial hiring in senior administration and a B-plus among professional administration levels. Those grades were lower for gender hiring, with women making up 28.6% of team senior administration positions (earning a C-minus) and 26% of professional administration positions (earning a D-plus).The Boston Red Sox led the league with 10 women in vice president positions or higher, while the San Francisco Giants were next with eight, according to the study."It's kind of a circle that goes around," Lapchick said. "Unless there's a breakout across the league with improvement, it's going to be very difficult to change the cycle."The study didn't include 2019 numbers on the small percentage of black players on opening day rosters. In 2018, that number was 8.4 percent, which was up from 7.7 percent in 2017 but far below the 18-percent mark of 1991, according to the study.TIDES released the report as MLB observes Jackie Robinson Day at ballparks across the country in honor of Robinson breaking baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947.___Follow Aaron Beard on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/aaronbeardap___More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_SportsDaily and Weekly newsletters available.Their new (re)new system uses less plastic, but it is a bit deceptive.There are a number of issues with bottled water, but the biggest one is probably the bottle, the amount of solid fossil fuel wrapped around the water. Now Evian, the French water company, is introducing (re)new, a 5-liter bubble full of water made of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET), which sits on a sort of countertop water cooler.Fast Company's Adele Peters picks up on the plastic savings:However, there is an asterisk after that statement pointing to small print on the press release that says, "*Compared, per litre of water, to a 1.5L evian bottle (3.33 x 1.5L evian bottles)." So it really means that the bubble uses 66 percent of the plastic that would be in 3.3 conventional bottles. Since every bottle contains more water in relation to its surface area as it gets bigger, this sounds a lot less impressive than at first glance.Then there is the electronics built into the base, which connects to an app on your phone and orders a new bubble of water when a refill is needed. So modern!The introduction of this sleek in-home natural mineral water appliance is the latest move from evian in its journey to become a circular brand by 2025 and will build on the brand's ambition to be carbon neutral by 2020.Now we love the circular economy here at TreeHugger, the idea that nothing goes to the dump and plastic all gets recycled; and we acknowledge that some people do have a need for bottled water (although they don't in London or Paris where the Evian bubble is being launched), so we won't even talk about the question of bottle vs tap. I drink bottled water all summer when I am away from a municipal water supply.But there has been a pretty much universal standard of 5 gallon or 18.9 litre refillable jugs for decades. That's almost 4 Evian bubbles and it is circular without having to recycle and remanufacture a PET bubble. It's solid and hard to puncture, whereas the Evian bubble has to be shipped in a cardboard box, no doubt made from recycled cardboard. I drag my jugs to the store and refill them there from a tested source, and have been using the same ones for a decade; now that's circular.I hate to puncture the Evian bubble, but the phrase "circular economy" is being used more and more to justify "business as usual"  we will keep packaging things in plastic, but will try to use a bit less and try to harder to recycle it. That's just not good enough anymore.Daily and Weekly newsletters available.It's proof that documentaries are powerful tools for change.When the BBC aired Blue Planet II in 2017, people were outraged about ocean plastic pollution like never before. It was suddenly a hot topic, being cited by everyone everywhere. People who had never done it before started taking reusable bags to the grocery store and refusing plastic packaging.But would the enthusiasm last? You know how it goes... the initial determination to live better wanes over time and habits return to their default state. Only time would tell.Researchers questioned 3,833 consumers in the United Kingdom and United States and found that more than half have reduced the amount of single-use plastic they are using in the last year. Forty-two percent of people consider sustainable materials to be important when making day-to-day purchases and tend to trust brands more if they make statements about sustainability. Motivations cited include concern for the future of the environment and wanting to reduce one's personal waste footprint.There was a significant difference between younger and older people's views. Older people (55-64) think it's more important for something to be affordable, whereas younger people (16 to 24) value sustainability more. Chase Buckle, trends manager at Global Web Index, explained,"It may come as a shock to some that the younger consumers are more considerate about sustainable materials than older generations. What is important to note, is that the younger generations grew up during the height of the sustainability crisis with high-profile, environmentalist documentaries widely available on the content platforms they prefer over conventional TV."This is hopeful news for times like these, as young people will grow up to become the decision-makers of the future. The more they care about the environment and reject plastics, the more those views will be reflected in policies going forward.Ken Powtak, Associated PressCaptionCloseBOSTON (AP)  Chris Davis knows his homer went a lot further than teammate Dwight Smith Jr.'s two-run shot. He also knows he'll have his time to gloat.Smith hooked his homer into the first row of seats down the right field line and drove in four, leading the Baltimore Orioles past the Red Sox 8-1 Monday in Boston's annual Patriots' Day game."He's been really doing well, there's no reason to talk," said Davis, smiling. "I'll wait a little bit and talk."Davis also had a two-run shot  estimated just short of 100 feet longer than Smith's  projected at 408 feet into the right-field bleachers."Honestly, I had no clue if it was going to get over," Smith said of his drive. "Whoever caught it might have helped me out, honestly. A homer is a homer. I'll take it anyway."Asked about Davis' shot, Smith said: "He crushed it. That's his name  'Crush'  for a reason."Renato Nez had three hits with an RBI single for Baltimore, which salvaged a split of the four-game series. It had lost nine of its previous 11 games and was 4-21 in its last 25 against Boston.Davis halted a record 0-for-54 stretch Saturday, the longest ever for a position player. He started the season 0 for 33.It was the 60th straight year the Red Sox were scheduled to play on the holiday. The defending World Series champs completed a 3-3 homestand and have yet to win one of their five series this season."It doesn't concern me. It's just a bad start," Boston manager Alex Cora said.Dan Straily (1-1) rebounded from a rough debut start with Baltimore, giving up a run on two hits in five innings. He was tagged for five runs and eight hits over 3 1/3 innings by Oakland last week.The Red Sox open a two-game series against the Yankees on Tuesday night in New York, the first meeting between the rivals since they ousted the Yanks in the divisional round of the playoffs last October.Leading 1-0, Baltimore scored three times in the fifth off reliever Marcus Walden. Smith's homer sliced into the seats about 20 feet down from the Pesky Pole, which is 302 feet away, and came after Jonathan Villar's RBI single.Smith added a two-run double.Boston played short-handed, with Andrew Benintendi out with a bruised right foot after fouling a ball off it Sunday, and Jackie Bradley Jr. out with the flu.That led the Red Sox to have catcher Christian Vzquez started at second base for the first time in his career. He handled two grounders and a tag play cleanly."He was smooth. He was smooth, man," Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts said. "Obviously behind the dish he's pretty smooth, so I didn't think we would have a problem with him back there."Orioles rookie manager Brandon Hyde got his first ejection, tossed by crew chief Mark Wegner after his challenge on the "slide rule" at second base was upheld. Hyde said he knew he was going to get thrown out."To me, they just made a wrong decision," Hyde said. "I didn't agree with the decision in New York at all."Spot starter Hector Velzquez (0-1) gave up a run in three innings.MOOKIE MADReigning AL MVP Mookie Betts was 0 for 3 and let his batting average drop to .222. He criticized himself harshly after the game, taking his share of the blame for Boston's surprising 6-11 start after last year's World Series championship."Basically, what I'm doing is unacceptable," Betts said. "I have to figure out a way to get something done and help the team."TRAINER'S ROOMOrioles: Smith was back in the lineup after not starting Sunday with a sore right leg.MARATHON BOMBINGS MEMORYThere was a moment of silence before the game.Six years ago, two bombs exploded near the Boston Marathon finish line less than an hour after the Red Sox beat Tampa Bay, killing three people and injuring more than 260.The Red Sox wore jerseys with "BOSTON" in red letters on the front - something they started during a Marathon tribute when they returned to the field at Fenway Park for the first time after the bombings.MOVING PARTSCora shifted his lineup all around.Besides Vzquez at second, Steve Pearce started in left field and Dustin Pedroia was at DH."Plenty of fun," Cora said about making the lineup. "These are the days that you really enjoy being a manager. It's a challenge and we're ready to play."An original lineup had Pedroia at second, Vzquez catching and Pearce as the DH.UP NEXTLHP Chris Sale (0-3, 9.00 ERA) looks to turn around his rough start against Yankees LHP James Paxton (1-2, 6.00) on Tuesday.__More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports BREAKING NEWS  PROGRAM ALERT WEATHER ALERT WeatherThreat.com ClosingsWest Lafayette, Ind.

Daily and Weekly newsletters available.1 million in grants will be divided among groups wanting to improve recycling facilities. But why should people have to compete for help in dealing with Starbucks' own trash?It has been just over a year since Starbucks introduced its 5p 'latte levy' on disposable cups. The minuscule fine is meant to discourage customers from choosing a disposable cup and encourage them to bring their own, a further incentive being the 25p discount they receive if they bring a reusable cup.The collected money goes into a Cup Fund held by Hubbub, an environmental charity that has outlined several different initiatives aimed at reducing single-use plastic use and pollution. Last summer Sami wrote about one of these latte levy-funded initiatives  taking children out on the Thames River to 'fish' for plastic. The initiative will increase the number of drop-off points for cup collection, which is something that people often struggle to find when they reach the end of their daily journeys, and provide clearer communication to customers about how to recycle effectively.In the words of Trewin Restorick, CEO of Hubbub,"We know that local authorities and building managers are committed to achieving their recycling targets but with increased strain on their budgets, investing in infrastructure is difficult. The launch of the Cup Fund means we will be able to collect cups in significant volumes in areas where there may not have been any drop-off points before."This is all well and good, but why is there no criticism of the consumption model? Much of this waste problem could be alleviated immediately if (a) disposable cups were exorbitantly expensive, upwards of 2-3 apiece, or (b) they were banned outright for being unsustainable and archaic. People adapt quickly. Avid coffee-drinkers will start carrying reusable cups, just like they do car keys and phones. It becomes a habit in no time.And doesn't it seem ridiculous that community groups have to compete for professional help with dealing with Starbucks' own trash? This is yet another example of Big Companies offloading responsibility for dealing with their own unsustainable and non-circular business models onto individual citizens. Starbucks should be held responsible for dealing with every single one of its cups, without anyone having to enter a competition to be deemed worthy of aid.In the meantime, I suppose it's progress of a sort that people are concerned about where their disposables end up. But let's not lose sight of the bigger picture and how celebrating coffee cup recycling is a lot like bragging about good mileage on one's private plane (as a commenter once described it). If you really want to feel good about your coffee habits, bring your own or use an in-store ceramic mug. There's no other way around it.

ASCENSION PARISH - Officials say a 19-year-old man pled guilty to indecent behavior with a juvenile and second-degree battery.On December 1, 2017 detectives with the Ascension Parish Sheriff's Office were contacted in reference to a sex crime complaint. During the investigation, authorities learned Tyler Johnson inappropriately touched a juvenile female.Johnson was arrested and booked into the Ascension Parish Detention Center. While in jail, Johnson got into a fight with another inmate on October 29, 2018. Authorities say Johnson punched an inmate in the face, which resulted in the inmate hitting his head on the floor. The inmate suffered a laceration to the back of his head. Johnson was charged with second-degree battery for the fight.For the indecent behavior with a juvenile charge, Johnson was sentenced to 25 years in jail with credit for time served. It was ordered that Johnson to serve 12 years of that sentence and the remaining 13 are to be suspended. After being released, he will be placed on five years supervised probation and he must register as a sex offender.For the fight at the jail, Johnston was sentenced to three years in jail with credit for time served.A massive fire broke out April 15, 2019, at Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral, one of the most visited landmarks in the world. Police said the fire is possibly linked to a renovation project that was underway at the church's spire.For good reason, onlookers wept Monday as they watched the gut-wrenching sight of flames engulfing Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris and toppling its delicate Gothic spire and wood roof.The cathedral, with its muscular bell towers, graceful flying buttresses and delicate rose windows, is a magnificent synthesis of engineering, architecture and art  a monument left by medieval builders that still dazzles the modern world.For Catholics, many of whom who regard Notre Dame as a monument to religious devotion as well as an architectural masterpiece, the timing of the blaze, during the week leading to Easter, made it all the more searing.French President Emmanuel Macron crystallized the thoughts of millions Monday when he tweeted that the blaze was like "a part of us being on fire."With Paris fire officials saying late Monday that they had prevented the fire from destroying Notre Dames main structure, the grim task ahead will be to determine the fires cause, assess the robustness of the structural elements that survive, and, if possible, map a route for rebuilding the edifice, more than 850 years old.If, as Paris fire officials suspect, the fire was caused by a $6.8 million renovation project on the church's spire, the conflagration would recall the 2006 fire that destroyed all but the exterior walls of Louis Sullivan and Dankmar Adlers Pilgrim Baptist Church on Chicagos South Side. That blaze broke out during roof repairs.You assume that people are taking the proper precautions if theyre using open flames, said Gunny Harboe, a Chicago architect who specializes in historic preservation. But clearly mistakes sometimes get made.Sometimes, he explained, contractors need to apply a flame directly to a surface to make repairs.The cathedrals of medieval France, built in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries, have beautiful but fragile roof systems that are made out of wood, said Harboe, who has visited Notre Dame several times. When the roof is centuries old, its just tinder. It doesnt take much to get it going.The first stone at Notre Dame was laid in 1163. The cathedral wasnt finished until 1345.The world watched in horror Monday as a fire engulfed one of its most beloved landmarks. As the blaze gutted Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, some Chicago-area residents in France witnessed the ruin.They described a fire that not only damaged the physical structure but wounded the heart of the city...Along the way, Notre Dames builders experimented with structural innovations  pointed arches, ribbed vaults and flying buttress (an arched exterior support)  that allowed them to reach once-unthinkable heights and transform exterior walls into diaphanous expanses of stained glass.In some ways, their rational approach anticipated the innovations that Chicago architects and engineers would use centuries later in designing the first skyscrapers in the 1880s.But unlike even greater realizations of the Gothic ideal at later cathedrals, the one in Paris is distinguished by its location in the center of the city, on an island in the Seine River. That embeds it in daily life, and in the public mind.Because its urban and its right in this tremendous confluence of governmental buildings, cultural buildings and university buildings, its more important by virtue of its contact with all these different things, said Alison Fisher, an associate curator of architecture and design at the Art Institute of Chicago.Indeed, the cathedral has come to represent French survival, having outlasted the Hundred Years War, the French Revolution and two world wars. By virtue of its age, scale and layers of history, it has no precise equivalent in Chicago. The castle-like Water Tower that survived the Great Fire of 1871 is a bauble by comparison.The cathedral took on added cultural relevance when it was immortalized in Victor Hugos 1831 novel, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the tale of the bell ringer Quasimodo.Looking ahead, experts on medieval architecture said Monday, a key question is whether the stone vaults over the cathedrals nave and crossing survived.The best case is that the stone exterior walls and vaults remain, said John Stamper, associate dean and professor of architecture at the University of Notre Dame. Theyll have to restore those vaults. There will be burn damage on them.  Thats better than having to rebuild the stonework. Theyll rebuild the roof and theyll have to rebuild the spire over the crossing.The worst case, Stamper added, is if the burning timber roof structure fell onto the vaults and caused them to collapse.The cathedral of Notre Dame has been damaged before, though never to this extent.During the French Revolution, the kingly statues lining the facade were beheaded. In the mid-19th century, the cathedral was restored by the French architect and author Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.In 2012, as the cathedral prepared to celebrated its 850th anniversary, a renovation added new lighting, built a platform to view the Gothic facade, renovated the organ and provided new bells.Last year, the Catholic Church in France made an urgent appeal for funds to restore the cathedral.Now, a much greater sum will be needed to restore one of Frances, and the worlds, great landmarks.Blair Kamin is a Tribune critic. bkamin@chicagotribune.comTwitter @BlairKaminBy Katelyn Caralle, U.s.

Trump tweeted.Trump also tweeted congratulations to the golfing legend over the weekend.This is Woods' fifth green jacket, and his win on Sunday is already being lauded as one of the greatest sports comebacks of all time.President Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods because of his success and comeback in sports and lifeWoods earned his fifth green jacket Sunday after it seemed his career was over following several physical obstacles and person issuesThe Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States that recognizes 'an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors'It was established in 1945 to honor civilian service during World War II.Other sports icons who have received the award include Michael Jordan, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Yogi Berra, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the past few years, it seemed as though Woods' career was over as he faced a series of personal problems and chronic back pain. He had a spinal fusion surgery in 2017.That same year, he faced charges for driving under the influence.Woods' personal life, and career, had already been on the decline before the back surgery and DUI charge when years before his ongoing cheating was brought to light.Woods won the Gene Serazen Cup in 2013 at the Cadillac Championship golf tournament at Trump National Dural in Florida. Trump is an avid golfer and often spends his free time on the courseWoods' last Masters win before Sunday was in 2005, 14 years agoWoods met his now-former wifeElin Nordegren in 2001, and they had two children.In 2009 the chronic cheating went public when the National Enquirer published a story outlining his relationship with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub hostess.Woods also had a relationship with cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs.Other than his two mistresses, Woods also reportedly had unprotected sex with porn starts.Following the scandals Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors of Woods lost billions of dollars collectively, and some dropped him completely.At the time, Woods released a statement saying he was 'taking an indefinite leave from golf to work on saving his marriage,' and wanted to focus 'on being a better husband, father, and person.'Woods had a few good seasons upon returning to golf after news of the affairs simmered, but never had another big win until this weekend.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBATON ROUGE - The Louisiana Legislative Auditor's Office said three Zachary government employees used city fuel cards for personal use, according to a recent audit.In July 2018, officials discovered the employees were using the cards inappropriately. The estimated amount of funds misappropriated was approximately $9,800.Two employees were suspended without pay for 35 days, put on six months probation, and had to pay back $1,300. Officials say the third employee was arrested. According to the audit, the employee resigned and agreed to forfeit vacation and sick pay.Policies were in place that would have prevented the fraud noted in this finding, but those policies were not followed as required. All Department Heads have now been instructed that they must follow the policy and report on their findings on a monthly basis. Some Departments, where feasible, have strengthened the policy where the cards are now checked out before use.Click here to read the full audit.Tweets by wbrztrafficBy Emily Crane For Dailymail.com  Published: 15:38 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 20:38 EDT, 15 April 2019   38View  commentsThe bodies of two young women who were found dead in a Texas oil field that was dubbed the infamous Killing Fields have finally been identified after 30 years following a breakthrough in forensic DNA analysis.Police on Monday identified the two women asAudrey Lee Cook, from Memphis, Tennessee, andDonna Prudhomme, from Port Arthur, Texas.Cook was found in 1986 and Prudhomme was discovered in 1991.The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside Houston.Police on Monday identified the two womenAudrey Lee Cook, (left) from Memphis, Tennessee, and Donna Prudhomme, (right) from Port Arthur, Texas.Cook was found in 1986 and Prudhomme was discovered in 1991Their bodies were uncovered in the same location where two other previously identified women were murdered and dumped. Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe.Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women.Cook, who born in1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found.She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985.Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine.Prudhomme, who was born in1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed.The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered.Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine.Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved.Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 15:43 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:24 EDT, 15 April 2019   724View  commentsThe world stood helpless as Notre Dame burned on Monday and hundreds of French fire fighters worked to put out the blaze.As they battled the flames, world leaders and celebrities took to social media in shock to share their sadness and disbelief.They likened the gut-wrenching images and videos of the cathedral's crumbling spire to like watching 'someone you love die'.United in their sadness, here are some of their reactions.Fire fighters continue to battle the flames at the Notre Dame in Paris, hours after a fire broke outPublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group totallygamergirl  15.

Dass Bremsen zur Steuerung gehrt, ist relativ zu sehen: Man hrt eigentlich nur auf zu beschleunigen, also man lsst die Maustaste los. Die Komplexitt der Steuerung erinnert eher an Games wie CSR, Timing ist entscheidend. Es ist halt ein Mobile-Game, mit Energieverbauch pro Rennen, welche sich aber langsam regeneriert, es gibt ingame-Kufe etc. Wer sowas zur Entspannung mag, kann sich dafr mal Zeit nehmen. Schwierigkeitseinstellungen gibt es immerhin auch, man kann strkere Gegnerfahrzeuge whlen und bekommt dafr mehr Belohnungen. Optisch ist es nicht schlecht, die Kamerafhrung erinnert eher an ein Action Replay.

Theyre like friends you might chat with. The wrentit and the Aberts towhee are like the neighbors you dont talk to much. As for the Hammonds flycatcher and the Brewers sparrow, Americans dont care much about them at all.Thats the word from a new study that aimed to define a range of relationships between people and birds across the United States, said Justin Schuetz, one of the authors.Results appear in a paper released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Schuetz, a biologist and independent researcher in Bath, Maine, did the work with Alison Johnston, whos affiliated with Cornell University in Ithaca, New YorkThe project included studying Google searches performed from 2008 to 2017 to learn about what Americans think about 621 bird species. Researchers knew where each search came from. They also knew the natural range of each species and how often it is sighted in specific places, based on a national database.One key question was whether the Google data revealed more interest in each species than one would expect in various locations, based on how often it is sighted in those places. Another question was how much the interest in each species was limited to its natural range, or spilled out beyond it.So birds in the celebrity category are those that attracted more Google attention than one would expect from how often theyre seen, and whose popularity extended outside of their natural range. They have a reputation beyond where they live, Schuetz explained.Next came the friends or enemies category, which included species that get more Google attention than expected, but mostly in the states where they live. As with the other categories, the researchers couldnt tell whether the searchers opinions of these familiar birds were positive or negative.Then came birds classified as neighbors, whose few Google searches were confined to where they live. Finally there were the strangers, birds that got little Google interest anywhere.The research also turned up other insights into what makes a species popular. Bigger bodies, colorful plumage and regular visits to birdfeeders helped. Species that served as mascots for professional sports teams reached celebrity status, but it wasnt clear whether being a mascot encouraged popularity or the other way around.The results also turned up some surprises. People seem to have an inordinate fascination with owls we couldnt account for entirely in our analysis, Schuetz said.Jeffrey Gordon, president of the American Birding Association, called the study a fascinating framework for trying to understand how people are relating to birds.I hope theyre able to use it to help people appreciate whats right in their own backyard, he said. Most of us just arent keyed in to what is literally at our doorstep.David Ringer, chief network officer for the National Audubon Society, also found the work interesting.Its great to see how much we know and love some species, and its provocative to see how much we still have to discover, he wrote in an email. I hope that many bird strangers will become friends, and neighbors will turn into celebrities.'___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education. The AP is solely responsible for all content.There is very little science behind most of the health claims made for CBD, the cannabis product turning up in cosmetics, foods and dietary supplements.With mainstream retailers Walgreens and CVS offering CBD skin products, its easy to believe there must be something special about the trendy ingredient. But the claims are largely unproven, quality control standards dont exist and the legal status of CBD-infused food is in doubt.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to hold a public hearing May 31 to gather more information on the science, manufacturing and sale of cannabis compounds such as CBD.A look at what we know as U.S. regulators work out what will and wont be allowed:WHAT IS CBD?CBD is one of more than 100 compounds found in marijuana. Its extracted using alcohol or carbon dioxide in factories. Its added to oils, mixed into creams and lotions and sold in candies and liquid drops.Widely sold online, CBD now is going mainstream. Prices range from $12 to $150 an ounce at high-end shops.CBD often comes from a cannabis plant known as hemp, which is defined by the U.S. government as having less than 0.3% THC. Thats important because THC is what causes marijuanas mind-altering effect.CBD doesnt get people high, although it may be calming. Keep in mind some CBD products may contain THC, whether or not the label says so.People drug tested for work, addiction programs or because they take prescription opioids should take note: CBD products have caused people to fail urine drug screens.IS IT A MIRACLE CURE?If you believe the hype, CBD treats pain, relieves anxiety and both helps you sleep and keeps you focused.Most claims are based on studies in rats, mice or in test tubes. Some human research has been done, but in small numbers of people.One exception: For two rare seizure disorders, the evidence for CBD was strong enough to convince the FDA to approve GW Pharmaceuticals drug Epidiolex, which contains a purified form.The FDA has sent warning letters to companies marketing products with claims for CBDs effects on cancer, Alzheimers disease, fibromyalgia and drug addiction.Only drugs that have been reviewed by the FDA as safe and effective can make claims that they treat or prevent diseases or medical conditions. Many CBD producers attempt to sidestep the issue by using only vague language about general health and well-being.ANY SIDE EFFECTS?Scant research means not much is known about side effects either. In epilepsy research, CBD changed the way the body processed other drugs. That suggests CBD could interact with medications in ways we still dont know about.The most common side effects of the CBD drug Epidiolex include sleepiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea, increases in liver enzymes, exhaustion, rash and infections. The potential for liver injury and other risks can be handled with medical supervision, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said earlier this month, but less is known about how that would be managed without oversight. And there are questions about overlap if multiple CBD products are used.IS IT LEGAL?For now, the FDA has said CBD is not allowed as an ingredient in food, drinks or dietary supplements.In stating its position, the FDA cited a provision of the law prohibiting food makers from using active drug ingredients or those still undergoing substantial research. But the agency doesnt have the resources to police all the CBD products that are already available, said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA official.Theyre not going to pull a thousand products from the market, he said.The FDAs authority is over interstate commerce, and local officials have taken differing approaches. In New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, officials are warning eateries to stop selling it in food and drinks. Maine passed a law allowing it in foods and other products in the state.Skin creams and cosmetics may be on safer footing with the FDA, but that too remains uncertain, said Camille Gourdet of RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in Durham, North Carolina. Though cosmetics arent subject to premarket approval by the FDA, they could run afoul of regulations if they make specific health claims.Marijuana itself is illegal under federal law; most states that have legalized it allow marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles.ARE CBD LABELS ACCURATE?What you buy may contain much less CBD than the label states  or much more. It may include more THC than you want and it may be contaminated with mold or pesticides. Ask to see testing reports.A 2017 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found 70% of CBD products were mislabeled. Researchers used an independent lab to test 84 products from 31 companies.Youre really flying by the seat of your pants when you buy this stuff, said author Marcel Bonn-Miller of University of Pennsylvania.A product labeled as containing 100 milligrams of CBD may only have 5 milligrams or it may have 200, said Bonn-Miller, now an adviser for a company that sells CBD and other cannabis products. He did not work in the industry when he did the research.I wouldnt trust any of it until I knew independently it was safe, Bonn-Miller said.WHATS AHEAD?CBD research is planned or underway for cancer, autism, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, alcoholism with PTSD and psychiatric conditions. Results will take years, but some people arent waiting.They are vulnerable and really hoping to feel better, said Karen Hande, a nurse practitioner at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville.She became an expert in CBD because so many of her cancer patients were trying it. She tells them the evidence isnt enough to back the claims, but they want to believe something is going to work.___Follow APs complete marijuana coverage: https://apnews.com/Marijuana___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

State officials will challenge a court ruling that revoked the water permit for a silver and copper mine proposed beneath a Montana wilderness area, a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation spokesman said Monday.Judge Kathy Seeley ruled state officials didnt adequately consider potential damage to nearby streams from Hecla Mining Co.s Rock Creek Mine northeast of Noxon.Attorneys for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation plan to file an appeal, said agency spokesman John Grassy. He declined to offer further details.The April 9 ruling does not affect the ability of Idaho-based Hecla to conduct exploratory work for the mine, which the U.S. Forest Service gave preliminary approval to last year, company spokesman Luke Russell said Monday.Environmental groups represented by Earthjustice had argued that streams within the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness are so ecologically valuable that they deserve the greatest protections available under law.Seeley agreed and in her April 9 order sent the matter back to the Department of Natural Resources Conservation for reconsideration.Its great news for wilderness, rivers and streams the critical habitat they provide for fish and wildlife, said Bonnie Gestring with Earthworks, one of the groups that challenged the water permit after it was issued in January 2018.Rock Creek would employ about 300 people and cover almost 500 acres.Montana regulators in a separate case have asked a judge to block Hecla CEO Phillips Baker, Jr. from exploring or opening new mines. They allege hes in violation of the states bad actor law because of ongoing pollution from a mining company where Baker once worked.

In a huge blow to Marquette's preseason top-five hopes, the Golden Eagles announced Monday that forwards Sam Hauser and Joey Hauser would be transferring out of the program.Sam Hauser told ESPN that he and his brother are planning to go to the same school.Sam Hauser will have to sit one year before playing his final season because he will not be a graduate transfer. Joey Hauser will have three years of eligibility after sitting out next season."We are thankful for all that Sam and Joey contributed to our program and University during their time at Marquette and wish them the best of luck in the future," head coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of returning players and are extremely excited about the upcoming season and future of our program."Sam, a 6-foot-8 junior, averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He shot 40.2 percent from 3-point range, marking the third season in a row he's made at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers.Joey, a 6-foot-9 freshman, averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his first season at Marquette. He also shot 42.5 percent from 3.Both players are officially in the transfer portal, sources told ESPN.With leading scorer Markus Howard back, Wojciechowski expected to have one of the best teams in the country next season. Without the Hausers, the Golden Eagles will likely fall toward the back end of the preseason top 25.Meanwhile, the Hausers will be two of the most sought-after transfers on the market.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?Het Openbaar Ministerie beschuldigt de Hagenaar en zijn familie van diefstal en witwassen, zo bleek tijdens de zitting. Naast hem zijn nog vijf andere (aangetrouwde) familieleden door het OM voor de rechter gesleept voor de fraudezaak die uit 2013 stamt.
Mensen werden voorbereid op het theoretische rijexamen met van het CBR gestolen informatie, aldus het OM. De broer van verdachte zou tientallen malen het instituut bezocht hebben om zelf examen te doen. Daardoor zou hij alle vragen geweten hebben. 

Volgens de 30-jarige Hagenaar was de informatie die de rijschool van zijn familie gebruikte helemaal niet afkomstig van het CBR, maar van een concurrerende rijschoolhouder in Den Haag. 'We merkten of zijn trucjes goed werkten.'
Hij zei ook dat de geheime opnames niet bij het CBR waren gemaakt. Dat zou gebeurd zijn bij cursussen van de concurrent voor het doen van het theoretisch rijexamen. 

Het Openbaar Ministerie denkt dat de Hagenaar en zijn familieleden grote sommen geld hebben verdiend met de rijexamenfraude. Tijdens een reis naar Turkije werden vier verdachten op Schiphol aangehouden met duizenden euros bij zich. Twee vrouwen hadden de biljetten ook in hun bhs gestopt. 
Volgens de Hagenaar is het in de Turkse cultuur gebruikelijk om veel cash geld te hebben. 'Wij leven in een cultuur van contanten.' Het geld was niet alleen afkomstig van de rijschool van de familie. Zijn vrouw had ook een eigen partycentrum, en zijn vader bezat een broodjeszaak. In Turkije had de Hagenaar een bankrekening waarop 114 duizend euro stond. Dat geld was volgens de Hagenaar niet van hem, maar van een oom.  

De advocaten van de zes verdachten vroegen maandag aan het begin van de zitting meteen om stopzetting van de fraudezaak, omdat het OM veel te lang heeft getreuzeld om die voor de rechter te brengen. 'Dit is een stokoude zaak', zei een van de advocaten. 
De rechtbank liet de zaak toch doorgaan. Dinsdag komt het Openbaar Ministerie met de strafeisen.Meld je aan op onze dagelijkse nieuwsbrief en blijf op de hoogte van alles wat er speelt in jouw omgeving.De Gouwenaar stond terecht voor negen strafbare feiten, waaronder brandstichting bij coffeeshop de Vriendschap aan de Cappenersteeg in november 2017 en n bij kapperszaak Allure Hairstyling aan de Lage Gouwe in oktober 2017 in Gouda. 
Voorafgaand aan de brand in de coffeeshop zou een kale man er de toegang zijn geweigerd door een beveiliger. 'Dat wordt nog leuk. Morgen hebben jullie geen coffeeshop meer', zou de bezoeker hebben gezegd. Op de camerabeelden is te zien hoe iemand die avond twee colaflessen met motorbenzine naar binnen giet, waarna kort daarop brand uitbreekt. 

De beveiliger van de coffeeshop zegt D. te herkennen. De witte sportsokken en de schoenen die de Gouwenaar droeg die avond, stonden ook op de camerabeelden van de brandstichter bij de coffeeshop. De brandweer vermoedt dat dezelfde persoon ook verantwoordelijk is voor de brand bij de kapperszaak een maand eerder, omdat daarbij ook een fles werd gebruikt. DNA van D. zat verder op een tas die na de brand bij de kapper werd aangetroffen. De verdachte ontkent betrokkenheid bij de branden. De inbraak in vakantiepark Landal Greenparks in Reeuwijk en de bedreiging van een gevangenismedewerker geeft D. wel toe. 
Volgens de officier van justitie reageert de verdachte 'extreem gewelddadig' wanneer hem iets niet zint. Ook vlak voor de brandstichting bij de kapperszaak zou hij ruzie hebben gehad met de eigenaresse. 'Hij is niet het braafste jongetje van de klas, ik schrik ook van zijn gedrag', zei de advocate van D. maandag tijdens de zitting. Maar de verdenkingen zijn volgens haar gebaseerd op 'roddel en achterklap'. De raadsvrouw wil dat de verdachte wordt vrijgesproken van de meeste feiten. 

De aanklaagster wil naast de celstraf en tbs, dat de Gouwenaar een schadevergoeding van bijna 1500 euro betaalt aan een bewoner naast de kapperszaak. De brand zou een grote impact op zijn gezin hebben gehad. Ze zouden 's nachts zijn omsloten door rook en met kleine kinderen moest het gezin hals over kop de woning verlaten.
Uitspraak over twee weken.

At first glance, the Bucks-Pistons series, which has the Eastern Conferences No. 1 seed going against a Blake Griffin-less 8 seed, falls into this category of skippable games. The final score of Game 1, 121-86 in favor of the Bucks, doesnt present much of a reason to watch the remaining three games.But! What if I told you that there is in fact a good reason to watch the rest of the Bucks-Pistons series, and that the reason is this: Giannis Antetokounmpo is going to clown the Pistons so badly that by the fourth quarter of Game 4 they will be huddled together at the center of the court, weeping and trembling and begging for a mercy they will not receive. Antetokounmpo scored 24 points and grabbed 17 rebounds in just 23 minutes during Game 1. The only conclusion to be drawn from the performance is that the Pistons, like every other team in the league, cant do anything to stop this guy. Antetokounmpo went wherever he wanted on the floor and did whatever he wanted to do once he got there; he was so much bigger and stronger and meaner than anyone else that he popped off the screen like a video game boss. In response, the Pistons did what angry and overmatched teams often do, and tried to get rough with Antetokounmpo. Former Buck Thon Maker sent the Greek Freak to the ground on a drive early in the game, and in the second half Andre Drummond gave up all pretense:If theres one thing weve learned about Antetokounmpo as hes fully come into his powers over the last few seasons, its that he can be a real bastard on the court. He told the whole world that Ben Simmons is a fucking baby for no other reason than Simmons kind of got in his way. What do you think hes going to do now that Drummond and the Pistons have antagonized him? AdvertisementYou only get to see a very good NBA player transform into a world-destroying superstar so many times in your life, and this season has offered us a chance to watch Antetokounmpo do just that. This is his first playoff series as the most unstoppable force in basketball, and now hes got a squad of petulant scrubs laid out in front of him, just begging to be humiliated.

Ein spezieller Straenbelag am Neckartor soll dafr sorgen, dass die Belastung mit Stickstoffdioxiden sinkt. Es ist ein weiterer Teil eines Manahmenkatalogs, den das Land beschlossen hat, um flchendeckende Fahrverbote fr Euro-5-Diesel zu verhindern. Auch an anderen Stellen in Stuttgart sollen solche Belge eingesetzt werden."Insgesamt hat sich die Schadstoffbelastung der Luft in den letzten Jahren aufgrund zahlreicher Luftreinhaltemanahmen deutlich verbessert", sagte am Montag der Leiter der Abteilung Straenverkehr und Straeninfrastruktur im Verkehrsministerium, Andreas Hollatz. In der Landeshauptstadt waren zuletzt zwar die Feinstaubwerte gesunken. Bei den Stickstoffdioxiden wurde im vergangenen Jahr an der Messstelle am Stuttgarter Neckartor allerdings noch ein durchschnittlicher Wert von 71 Mikrogramm pro Kubikmeter Luft registriert - die hchste registrierte Belastung in Deutschland. Erlaubt ist in der EU ein Jahresmittelwert von 40 Mikrogramm pro Kubikmeter Luft.Trotzdem kndigte die grn-schwarze Landesregierung in der vergangenen Woche bereits an, angesichts neuer Prognosen zur Luftreinhaltung auf flchendeckende Fahrverbote fr Diesel der Euronorm 5 in Stuttgart zu verzichten. Es kmen allenfalls nur noch einzelne, streckenbezogene Verbote in Betracht, sagte Ministerprsident Winfried Kretschmann (Grne). "Aber wir tun alles, um das auch zu vermeiden."Schon im Februar hatte die Koalition Zeitplne fr Luftreinhaltungsmanahmen in Stuttgart festgezurrt. Ein Teil davon: der Hightech-Asphalt am Neckartor. Die Deckschicht des Straenbelags der Firma Strabag enthlt Titandioxid, das Stickoxide in unschdliche Stoffe umwandelt, wie Verkehrsministerium und Stadt Stuttgart mitteilten. Das Projekt wird wissenschaftlich begleitet. Die Ergebnisse sollen im Sommer vorliegen.Noch bis Mittwoch wird der Straenbelag zwischen Willy-Brandt-Strae und Cannstatter Strae mit dem speziellen Gemisch erneuert. Das Land beteiligt sich mit bis zu 200 000 Euro. Insgesamt kostet die Erneuerung 700 000 Euro. Den Rest trgt die Stadt.Zudem ist geplant, Gebude des Landes am Neckartor und an weiteren besonders belasteten Straen mit einer speziellen Farbe zu bestreichen, welche Stickstoffdioxide binden soll. Darber hinaus sollen bestehende Feinstaub-Filtersulen am Neckartor so umgerstet werden, dass sie auch Stickstoffdioxide absorbieren.Schuld an den Fahrverboten in Stuttgart sind die erhhten Werte von Stickstoffdioxid. Im Kampf um saubere Luft hat man sich in der Landeshauptstadt bislang aber vor allem auf den Feinstaub konzentriert. So wurden beispielsweise Filtersulen aufgestellt, die die Partikel aus der Luft aufnehmen sollen. Nassstaubsauger sirrten whrend der Feinstaubsaison im Winter ber Straen und Gehwege rund um die Messstelle. Auch eine 300 Quadratmeter groe Mooswand wurde aufgestellt, ihr Effekt lie sich allerdings nicht belegen. 2018 konnten auch dank gnstiger Wetterbedingungen die Grenzwerte fr Feinstaub eingehalten werden.Um die EU-Grenzwerte fr Stickstoffdioxide einzuhalten, drfen seit Jahresbeginn keine Diesel, die unter die Schadstoffklasse 4 oder schlechter fallen, in die Umweltzone der Landeshauptstadt fahren. Allerdings gibt es zahlreiche Ausnahmen etwa fr den Lieferverkehr, Handwerker und Pendler im Schichtdienst.Ab sofort knnen auch viele Park&Ride-Anlagen in Stuttgart wieder mit lteren Diesel-Autos angefahren werden. Als Nachweis knne dabei unter anderem ein gltiges Ticket fr ffentliche Busse und Bahnen oder ein Parkschein beziehungsweise eine Parkquittung dienen, so ein Sprecher des Verkehrsministeriums. Ist eine Park&Ride-Anlage gebhrenfrei, msse der Autofahrer die Fahrt plausibel erlutern.Lesen Sie Ihre Zeitung immer und berall digital: Hier ePAPER-Angebote entdecken! SectionsPabubha Manek's victory from Dwarka Assembly constituency in 2017 was challenged by his Congress opponentThe Supreme Court Monday agreed to hear on April 22 the appeal of BJP leader Pabubha Manek challenging the Gujarat High Court's decision invalidating his election from Dwarka Assembly seat.The Gujarat High Court had on April 12 set aside the election of Pabubha Manek for submitting a defective nomination form and ordered by-election for the seat.Mr Manek's victory from the Dwarka Assembly constituency in 2017 was challenged in the high court by his opponent and Congress candidate Meramanbhai Goria.A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said it will hear Manek's appeal against the high court verdict next Monday.Mr Goria, in his petition, had said Mr Manek's election should be set aside as he had submitted a defective nomination form having no mention about the name and number of the constituency, that is "82-Dwarka".Admitting the contention raised by him, the court had cancelled the election held for the Dwarka seat in December 2017, saying that the defect in the nomination form was a "defect of substantial character as contemplated under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951".Though Mr Goria had also sought to declare himself as the winner for garnering second highest vote after Mr Manek in the poll, the court had not accepted that plea and only ordered the cancellation of the election of Mr Manek, who is a seven-time MLA from that constituency.In his petition, Mr Goria had claimed that there was no mention of the name and number of the constituency in Mr Manek's nomination form, a lapse which calls for cancellation of his election.As per the petition, Mr Manek's proposer Dharnant Bhulabhai Chavda mentioned his own name in a column meant for mentioning the number of and name of the constituency, that is "82-Dwarka".Instead of writing "82-Dwarka" in the specified space, Mr Chavda wrote his full name in the nomination form.The high court had held that it was indeed a "defect of substantial character" as per the Representation of the People Act and according to some past Supreme Court judgements.The court had also noted that the returning officer's action of rejecting the objections filed by Ahir at that time against Mr Manek's nomination was "illegal".The court had said the result of the election has been "materially affected by improper acceptance" of the nomination of Manek at that time.Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Zum Anpfiff einen Sekt aus Brasilien, in der ersten Halbzeit neun Weiweine, in der zweiten Halbzeit gabs Rotwein und zum Abpfiff einen Bio-Sekt. Bei der Weinprobe zugunsten der Giovane-Elber-Stiftung haben sich in der Winterbacher Kelter zwei Dutzend Weinkenner von Weinkritiker Rudolf Knoll unterhalten lassen und in der Halbzeitpause noch manch edle Tropfen ersteigert. Wein und Fuball  das hlt auch die deutsche Wein-Elf zusammen, die die Weine gestiftet hat.Um Tore gings nach dem Anpfiff nicht, es ging um brasilianische Straenkinder: Wie bei allen Aktionen, die sich die Giovane-Elber-Stiftung einfallen lsst, wird auch der Erls dieser ersten Benefiz-Weinprobe benachteiligten Kindern zugutekommen. Und weil Giovane Elber, der von 1994 bis 1997 beim VfB gekickt und in Winterbach gewohnt hat, Ehrenmitglied der deutschen Wein-Elf ist, war die Auswahl enorm: Eingerahmt von einem brasilianischen und einem deutschen Sekt, gab es 16 von der Wein-Elf gestiftete Tropfen zu probieren. Arrangiert und fachlich begleitet von Weinkritiker Rudolf Knoll. Der gebrtige Mnchner, Jahrgang 1947, lebt in der Oberpfalz, schreibt seit 40 Jahren in Artikeln und in mehr als 50 Bchern ber Wein. Auerdem ist auch er Mitglied der deutschen Fuball-Nationalmannschaft der Winzer. Da war der Kontakt nach Winterbach nur eine Frage der Zeit  auch wenn sich Richard Schrade, bis vor einem Jahr Vorsitzender des Vereins zur Frderung brasilianischer Straenkinder, lange nicht zu fragen getraut hat. Schlielich ist die Wein-Elf schon ein groer Sponsor des Vereins und stiftet seit Jahren Weine fr dessen Weihnachtsmarkt-Tombola.Doch kaum war die Anfrage raus, war die Auswahl zusammengestellt und Knoll am Freitagabend zu Gast in Winterbach, um mit zwei Dutzend Weinkennern Weine zu testen, die einen mehr oder weniger starken Bezug zum Fuball haben: Los gings mit einem 2017er Gutedel Kabinett Markgrflerland vom Weingut Rainer Schlumberger aus Laufen. Tochter Josefine Schlumberger wurde 2015 zur Deutschen Weinknigin gewhlt und trgt in der Wein-Elf Trikot-Nummer 94. Bei Gutedel, das war bei der Weinprobe zu erfahren, handelt es sich um eine alte, lange unterschtzte badische Weinsorte. Der zweite Wein der ersten Halbzeit stammte aus dem sdafrikanischen Weingut Lammershoek, an dem Franz Beckenbauer beteiligt ist. Ein Weiwein, der auch wunderbar zum deutschen Spargel passt, stellte Knoll fest und gab bei dieser Gelegenheit zum Besten, dass er in seiner Jugend als Torhter beim FC Wacker Mnchen niemand Geringeren als den spteren Fuball-Kaiser zur Verzweiflung gebracht hat.Und die Mitglieder der Wein-Elf haben sich nicht lumpen lassen: Es folgte eine Reihe Grauburgunder  von der Winzergenossenschaft Oberbergen, vom Weingut Lergenmller aus Hainfeld/Birkweiler und vom Weingut Reiner Probst aus Achkarren, fr Rudolf Knoll einer der Torgaranten der Wein-Elf: Beim Kick gegen den FC Bundestag hat Probst jedenfalls zwei Tore geschossen. Die Riesling-Reihe, die folgte, war ebenso illuster: vom Weingut Winter aus Dittelsheim/Rheinhessen, vom Weingut Spreitzer und dem Weingut Carlo Dillmann aus dem Rheingau. Und vor dem Abpfiff: eine Sptlese vom Weingut Blesius aus Graach an der Mosel.Die zweite Halbzeit war den Rotweinen gewidmet: von einer 2017er Edeltechniker-Cuve aus der Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn und einem 2017er Corazn Loco tinto aus dem Weingut des spanischen Fuballstars Andrs Iniesta ber einen 2016er Badenheimer St. Laurent des Weinguts Steitz aus Rheinhessen bis zu zwei Sptburgundern aus dem Weingut Sohns im Rheingau und dem Weingut Weinreich aus Rheinhessen. Dazwischen gab es allerhand unterhaltsame Anekdoten  ber die ersten Barrique-Versuche in den 1980ern (die mussten noch nach Eiche schmecken) und den neuesten Orange Wine-Trend, der seit zwei, drei Jahren ungeschwefelte Weiweine auf den Markt bringt, die wie Rotwein mittels Maischegrung hergestellt werden.Ein ambitioniertes Programm  unterbrochen von einer Halbzeitpause, in der in einer Auktion auch noch eine ganze Reihe von gestifteten Weinen versteigert wurden. Auktionator war Rudolf Knoll, der Erls fr die Giovane-Elber-Stiftung: 740 Euro. Zu ersteigern gab es nicht nur Weine von den Weingtern von Iniesta und Beckenbauer, sondern auch einen 2006er Sptburgunder WM-Wein mit einem Autogramm von Gerd Mller auf der Doppel-Magnum-Flasche. Es gab Weine von der Remstalkellerei und vom Weingut Jrgen Ellwanger: einen 2007er Hades Zweigelt, mit dem deutschen Rotweinpreis ausgezeichnet, und einen 1976er Grunbacher Klingle, den der Winterbacher Wengerter als Raritt letztlich selbst ersteigert hat.Giovane-Elber-Stiftung1994 grndeten sechs Winterbacher Seniorenfuballer zusammen mit Fuball-Profi Giovane Elber den Verein zur Frderung brasilianischer Straenkinder. 2009 folgte die Stiftung, die in Elbers Heimatstadt Londrina das Ausbildungszentrum Pestalozzi und den Kinderhort Casa do Caminho gebaut hat. Auerdem konnte der Verein eine Chemotherapie-Station in der Kinderkrebsklinik Londrina einrichten. Winterbacher Knstler, viele Paten, Mitglieder und andere Untersttzer spenden regelmig fr die Projekte  mittlerweile insgesamt mehr als eine Million Euro.Wer die Giovane-Elber-Stiftung und damit brasilianische Straenkinder untersttzen mchte, kann auch eine Patenschaft bernehmen: Mit einem monatlichen Patenschaftsbetrag von 20 Euro knnen Kosten fr Bildungsangebote, Mahlzeiten und medizinische Versorgung bernommen werden.Weitere Informationen zur Arbeit der Stiftung gibt es auch im Internet unter www.giovane-elber-stiftung.de.Lesen Sie Ihre Zeitung immer und berall digital: Hier ePAPER-Angebote entdecken! SectionsNotre-Dame Fire: Flames and smoke plumed from the spire and roof of the Notre Dame cathedral (Reuters)French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, after a colossal fire tore through the building, sending the spire crashing to the ground and wiping out centuries of heritage.Macron expressed relief that "the worst had been avoided" in a blaze that had at one point threatened the entire edifice, and left France in shock over the damage to a building described as the soul of the nation. The inferno destroyed the roof of the 850-year-old UNESCO world heritage landmark, whose spectacular Gothic spire collapsed as orange flames and clouds of grey smoke billowed into the sky.Notre Dame is one of the world's great treasures, and we're thinking of the people of France in your time of grief. It's in our nature to mourn when we see history lost - but it's also in our nature to rebuild for tomorrow, as strong as we can. pic.twitter.com/SpMEvv1BzBSo horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.

Bewohner der Paulinenpflege und vom Haus Elim besuchten gemeinsam mit dem Leutenbacher VfB-Fanclub Wei-Rote Schwoba das Heimspiel der Roten gegen Bayer Leverkusen.Samstag um kurz nach 14 Uhr kommt der Bus des Fanclubs vor dem Mercedes-Benz-Museum an. Schneeregen fllt vom Himmel. Ungemtlich. Trotz allem steigen strahlende Gesichter aus dem Bus: Vorfreude. Mindestens eine VfB-Mtze hat jeder auf. Die meisten tragen auch Trikots und Schals in Wei und Rot. Rollsthle werden aus dem Bus geladen mit groen VfB-Wappen auf den Rdern.Wann geh mer endlich rein?, ruft einer. Gleich. Erst will Benjamin Layer, Vorsitzender des Fanclubs, noch ein Gruppenbild machen. Gemeinsam entrollen sie ein groes Banner mit der Aufschrift Alle fr einen - Gute Besserung, Michel. Michel ist Bewohner der Paulinenpflege und nach einem schweren Unfall im Dezember noch immer im Krankenhaus, weshalb er auch am Ausflug nach Bad Cannstatt nicht teilnehmen kann.Nach dem Foto geht es in Richtung Stadion. Vor den Kartenkontrollen knnen es einige Bewohner der Paulinenpflege kaum abwarten. Schnurstracks marschieren sie auf den Eingang zu, bis sie merken, dass sie noch gar keine Karte haben. Kommando zurck, Eintrittskarten holen und rein ins Stadion. Je nher der Fanclub mit seinen Gsten den Sitzpltzen auf der Haupttribne kommt, desto mehr fachsimpeln die treuen VfBler aus der Paulinenpflege und dem Haus Elim ber die aktuelle Situation des VfB und Lieblingsspieler, wobei auffllig oft der Name Mario Gomez fllt. Wie das Spiel heute wohl ausgeht? 4 zu 3 tippt einer, ein anderer 3 zu 1. Optimistisch sind sie alle, keiner tippt gegen den VfB.Wir mssen mal wieder gewinnen, weil sonst steigen wir ab, erzhlt Marco. Er ist einer der wenigen, die manchmal auch alleine ins Stadion gehen. Viele sind auf Hilfe angewiesen, die ihnen heute Fanclub-Mitglieder und die ebenfalls anwesenden Mitarbeiter der Paulinenpflege geben. Der Ansto rckt nher. Bei der Hymne Fr immer VfB zckt Marco sein Handy und filmt begeistert mit. Der Titel des Liedes ist fr ihn Programm, denn er sagt: Pavard geht zu Bayern. Ich nicht. Ich bleibe fr immer beim VfB.Die Mannschaft mit dem roten Brustring kommt gut in die Partie gegen den Favoriten aus dem Rheinland. Alexander Esswein hat nach einigen Minuten eine gute Chance, aber scheitert am Torhter. Marco kann es nicht fassen. Er schlgt die Hnde ber dem Kopf zusammen und bleibt einige Sekunden wie angewurzelt stehen. Leverkusen wird besser, aber der VfB geht mit einem 0:0 in die Kabine. Die mssen mal mehr aufs Tor schieen, sagt ein Bewohner der Winnender Wohngruppe.Seinen Rat befolgen die Stuttgarter in der zweiten Halbzeit nicht. Im Gegenteil. Castro foult, es gibt Elfmeter fr die Leverkusener, die dadurch in Fhrung gehen. Der VfB rennt dem Rckstand vergeblich hinterher und verliert knapp. Zu viel fr Tim, der sein Gesicht im Schoss vergrbt. So lange hatte er sich auf den Stadionbesuch gefreut und dann solche eine Enttuschung. Trnen kullern ber seine Wangen. Wenn die so weitermachen, dann steigen sie ab, sagt Marco. Dann wird wohl nicht nur Benjamin Pavard den Verein verlassen, sondern ein Groteil der jetzigen Mannschaft.Im Gegensatz zu den Treuen aus dem Haus Elim und der Paulinenpflege. Sie kommen ganz gewiss wieder. Sptestens im nchsten Jahr mit dem Fanclub Wei-Rote Schwoba.Die Eintrittskarten auf der Haupttribne hat der VfB gespendet.

De Notre-Dame de Paris, in het Nederlands Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal, waar maandagavond een grote brand woedt, is een kathedraal op het le de la Cit, in het centrum van Parijs.De eerste steen werd gelegd in 1163. Maurice de Sully, destijds bisschop van Parijs, geldt als de bouwmeester van de imposante kerk. In 1845 volgde een grote renovatie, die 23 jaar duurde. Dat was om de schade te herstellen die bij de Franse Revolutie was aangericht. Er werden toen ook veel kunstwerken uit de kerk geroofd.Karakteristiek zijn de twee torens, om onduidelijke redenen nooit afgebouwd, die 69 meter hoog zijn. Ook kenmerkend zijn de luchtbogen. En van die torens is nu reeds volledig verloren.De kathedraal is opgetrokken in een vroeggotische stijl. De westgevel is versierd met beeldhouwwerk. De beroemde waterspuwers, afgebeeld als monsters, stammen uit de middeleeuwen. Het gebouw is ongeveer 130 meter lang, 48 meter breed en 35 meter hoog, en heeft vijf schepen (ruimtes). Het zeer bijzondere orgel in de kerk bestaat uit maar liefst 7000 pijpen en is eind vorige eeuw helemaal gerenoveerd.DoornenkroonIn 1804 kroonde Napoleon Bonaparte zichzelf tot keizer in de Notre-Dame en ook zijn er veel presidenten, schrijvers en militairen begraven. De kerk herbergt enkele relikwien van Christus: de doornenkroon, een stuk uit het kruis en van de spijkers die zouden zijn gebruikt bij de kruisiging. Of die door de brand zijn aangetast, is vooralsnog onduidelijk.De kathedraal kreeg ook veel bekendheid door het boek van Victor Hugo: De Klokkenluider van de Notre-Dame. Er hangen ook echt klokken, die elk honderden kilos wegen.De Notre-Dame is een kerk van de Rooms-Katholieken. De aartsbisschop van Parijs heeft er zijn domicilie. Ook zijn er nationale vieringen. De toegang is gratis. Miljoenen mensen brengen jaarlijks een bezoek aan de kathedraal.De uitvinding van de gotiekDe Notre-Dame is misschien het belangrijkste symbool van de Franse architectuur, zegt journaliste en Frankrijk-kenner Mia Doornaert. Dit is het toppunt van de Gotische architectuur, de bouwstijl die het mogelijk maakte voor hoger dan voorheen te bouwen, dankzij de gewelven-structuur. De Gotiek maakte het mogelijk om licht binnen te brengen in kerken.Vandaag is de Notre-Dame veel meer dan een kathedraal. Veel meer dan een plek van gebed. De Notre-Dame is het symbool dat Parijs verenigt. De plek waar de Parijzenaars weten waar ze heen moeten op momenten van diepe rouw zoals de aanslagen van Charly Hebdo of in de Bataclan. Dan werden in de Notre-Dame diensten gehouden, die de verschillende godsdiensten overstijgen. Zelf een agnost als Mitterand kreeg in de Notre-Dame een uitvaart, zet Mia Doornaert.In tekenfilmsDe Notre-Dame is ook de inspiratie voor andere kunstenaars. Natuurlijk is er het wereldbekende verhaal van de klokkenluider van de Notre-Dame van Victor Hugo. Met de hartbrekende geschiedenis tussen Quasimodo en de mooie Esmeralda. Maar de kathedraal en omgeving zijn ook het decor waartegen de animatiefilms The Aristocats en Ratatouille spelen. KRC Genk ligt op titelkoers. Het won vrijdag overtuigend met 1-3 van Standard en kan met een gerust ...SectionsThe Indian Air Force chief was addressing a gathering at a seminar on aerospace power (File)Technology was on India's side in the Balakot air strikes, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said on Monday, asserting that the results would have been further tilted in the country's favour if Rafale jets were inducted in time.The Indian Air Force chief was addressing a gathering at a seminar on aerospace power of the future and the impact of technology."In the Balakot operation, we had technology on our side, and we could launch precision stand of weapons with great accuracy. In the subsequent engagements, we came out better because we upgraded our MiG-21s, Bisons, and Mirage-2000 aircraft," he said."The results would have been further skewed in our favour had we inducted the Rafale aircraft in time," Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said.The Air Force struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir's Balakot area on February 26, in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.The Pakistan Air Force retaliated the next day by unsuccessfully targeting various military installations in Jammu and Kashmir.Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said in his speech, "In the proposed induction of the Rafale and S-400 surface-to-air missile system, in the next two-four years, once again the technological balance will shift in our favour, like it was in 2002 during Operation Parakaram during the last stand-off."India inked an inter-governmental agreement with France in September 2016 for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets at a cost of around Rs 58,000 crore. The delivery of the jets -- capable of carrying a range of potent weapons and missiles -- is scheduled to begin from September.In October last year, India and Russia signed a multibillion dollar deal for S-400 ''Triumf'' long-range air defence missile systems. It has the capability to destroy incoming hostile aircraft, missiles and even drones at ranges of up to 400 km.The seminar on ''Aerospace power in the 2040s: Impact of Technology'' was held at Subroto Park here to mark the birth centenary of the late Marshal of the IAF Arjan Singh.The event was hosted by the IAF along with the Centre for Air Power Studies (CAPS), an autonomous defence research and analysis body."Among all arms of the military, technology affects us the most.. land forces mainly fight with men, naval and air force officers operate machines and in the Air Force this technology has to be packed in smaller machines and subject to extreme temperature and pressure conditions," the IAF chief said.And, air power is more sensitive to technological change, he said.Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week complimented the IAF for its "flawless execution" of the February 26 Balakot operation and subsequent thwarting of the Pakistani response while addressing top IAF commanders.At the event on April 11, Mr Dhanoa emphasised on further enhancing the IAF's capability in the field of space, cyber, artificial intelligence and drone technology to further boost its overall combat capability.Various IAF veterans, at the seminar paid tribute to Singh, who led the Indian Air Force during the 1965 India-Pakistan war, died in September 2017 at the age of 98.An icon in the country's military history, Mr Singh led a fledgling IAF in the 1965 Indo-Pak war when he was just 44 years old.Born on April 15, 1919, in Lyallpur in Punjab in undivided India, his father, grandfather and great grandfather had served in the cavalry."This event is a fitting tribute to IAF Marshal Arjan Singh," Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa said.Get the latest election news, live updates and election schedule for Lok Sabha Elections 2019 on ndtv.com/elections.

Der Fuball-Fachmann will zusammen mit der Stiftung das Engagement gegen den Herztod weiter vorantreiben.Die Bjrn Steiger Stiftung ist wichtig, weil sie allen Altersgruppen das Bewusstsein vermittelt, wie wichtig es ist, Leben zu erhalten, sagt Neururer. Von Kindesbeinen an knne man mit ernsten Situationen konfrontiert werden. Von Kindesbeinen an knne man aber auch Lsungen finden. Je frher man sich bewusst macht, dass jeder einen Beitrag dazu leisten kann, Menschenleben zu retten, desto besser ist es, so Neururer weiter.  Der Trainer musste selbst schon Erfahrungen mit dem Thema Herztod sammeln. Im Jahr 2012 erlitt er beim Golfspielen in Gelsenkirchen einen Herzstillstand und musste wiederbelebt werden. Das war dramatisch, sagt er rckblickend. Ich habe nichts geahnt, krperlich war ich topfit. Seine Rettung verdanke er glcklichen Umstnden. Pierre-Enric Steiger, Prsident der Bjrn Steiger Stiftung, ist Neururer fr sein Engagement daher sehr dankbar. Wir freuen uns, dass wir mit Peter Neururer einen absolut authentischen Botschafter gewonnen haben, sagt Steiger. So dramatisch seine Geschichte auch ist: Sie zeigt, dass schnelle Erste Hilfe Leben retten kann. Dies aufzuzeigen, ist das Kernanliegen unserer Stiftung.Groe Lebenseinschrnkungen muss Peter Neururer nach seinem Herzstillstand nicht hinnehmen. Rauchen ist allerdings tabu. Mental hat sich bei Peter Neururer in seinem Leben danach aber durchaus viel gendert. Er geht mit mehr Gelassenheit durch Leben. Mein Bewusstsein fr die Wichtigkeit der Dinge hat sich gendert, sagt Neururer. Ich rege mich nicht mehr ber Sachen auf, von denen ich glaube und wei, dass ich keinen Einfluss darauf habe. Frher habe es ihn als Trainer aufgewhlt, wenn einem seiner Spieler der Ball vom Fu rutschte und seine Mannschaft dadurch ein Gegentor kassierte. So etwas belchle ich heute zwar nicht, betont der Trainer. Ich gehe aber darber hinweg und sage: Warum soll ich hier Energie verschwenden? So etwas passiert.  Boschafter Peter Neururer spricht in einem Videoclip der Bjrn Steiger Stiftung ber die Hintergrnde seines Engagements. Zu finden ist der Clip auf der Website der Stiftung und auf den Social-Media-Kanlen. Die Untersttzung geht aber weiter: Geplant ist, mehrere Sportvereine der Region herzsicher zu machen. Stiftungsmitarbeiter statten die Vereine mit Laien-Defibrillatoren (AED = Automatisierter Externer Defibrillator) aus. Darber hinaus machen sie die Vereinsmitglieder durch Schulungen fit in Sachen Wiederbelebung und erlutern den Umgang mit den AED-Gerten. Peter Neururer wird bei diesen Terminen dabei sein und aus erster Hand davon berichten, wie wichtig es ist, im Notfall Erste-Hilfe-Kenntnisse anwenden zu knnen. Ich freue mich auf diese Aufgabe, sagt Neururer. Es ist mir ein ganz wichtiges Anliegen, mit dafr zu sorgen, dass Hemmschwellen beim Thema Erste Hilfe abgebaut werden.Rund 100.000 Menschen sterben in Deutschland pro Jahr am Herztod. Dabei haben Betroffene eine realistische berlebenschance, wenn Ersthelfer sofort nach Eintritt des Herzstillstands mit einer Herzdruckmassage beginnen und schnellstmglich einen Defibrillator zum Einsatz bringen. Zusammen mit der Herzdruckmassage sorgt ein solches Gert dafr, dass ein aus dem Takt geratenes Herz wieder in den richtigen Rhythmus kommt.  Die Bjrn Steiger Stiftung hat den Kampf gegen den Herztod seit Jahren intensiv aufgenommen. Im Rahmen ihrer 2013 gestarteten Initiative Herzsicher stattet sie aktuell ganze Landkreise und Stdte mit Laien-Defibrillatoren aus und schult die Bevlkerung in Sachen Wiederbelebung. Seit 2001, als der Kampf gegen den Herztod begann, konnte die Bjrn Steiger Stiftung bereits rund 26.000 Laien-Defibrillatoren in Verkehr bringen. Wir sind sehr zuversichtlich, dass wir mithilfe engagierter Persnlichkeit wie Peter Neururer weitere Erfolge verbuchen knnen, sagt Stiftungsprsident Steiger. Botschafter Neururer hat dieses Ziel ebenfalls ins Auge gefasst. Im 50. Bestehensjahr wnscht er der Stiftung, dass sie weiterhin Erfolgszahlen schreibt.Auf dem Heimweg vom Schwimmbad wurde der achtjhrige Bjrn Steiger von einem Auto erfasst. Es dauerte fast eine Stunde bis der Krankenwagen eintraf. Bjrn starb am 3. Mai 1969 nicht an seinen Verletzungen, er starb am Schock. Seine Eltern Ute und Siegfried Steiger grndeten daraufhin am 7. Juli 1969 die Bjrn Steiger Stiftung als gemeinntzige Organisation mit dem Ziel die deutsche Notfallhilfe zu verbessern. Meilensteine dieses Engagements sind z. B. die Einfhrung des bundesweit einheitlichen und kostenfreien Notrufs 110/112, der Aufbau der Notruftelefonnetze an deutschen Straen, die Einfhrung des Sprechfunks im Krankenwagen und der Aufbau der Luftrettung. Aktuelle Initiativen widmen sich insbesondere dem Kampf gegen den Herztod, der Breitenausbildung in Wiederbelebung, der Sensibilisierung von Kindern und Jugendlichen fr den Notfall, dem Frhgeborenentransport und der Alarmierung von Ersthelfern per App.Lesen Sie Ihre Zeitung immer und berall digital: Hier ePAPER-Angebote entdecken! Waiblingen. S-Bahn-Chaos und berfllte Busse - Wer am Wochenende ganz gemtlich nach Stuttgart zum Einkaufen fahren wollte, drfte das sptestens bei der Ankunft am Bahnhof bereut haben. Wie sieht es aber am Wochenenanfang aus, wenn unzhlige Pendler zur Arbeit fahren mssen? Unsere Reporter vor Ort berichten live aus Bus und Bahn. 09.50 Uhr:Ein Kollege aus der Redaktion schwelgt im Glck: Er sei um 8.53 Uhr mit dem Wiesel-Ersatzbus von Miedelsbach nach Schorndorf losgefahren (denn auch die Wieslauftalbahn fhrt aktuell nicht aufgrund von Bahnsteig-Umbauarbeiten). Der Umstieg in Schorndorf auf den Direktbus gen Waiblingen: "kein Problem". Die Situation im Bus: "gengend Platz fr alle um diese Uhrzeit." Die Fahrzeit: "Der Bus war pnktlich in Waiblingen." Zeitverzug gegenber sonst: "20 Minuten". Jetzt lsst sich der Kollege erstmal einen Capuccinoaus der neuen Redaktionsmaschine. Fazit: Wer erst gegen 10 Uhr bei der Arbeit sein muss, ist klar im Vorteil. Aber bevor hier Sozialneid aufkommt: Redakteure arbeiten abends lnger.09.30 Uhr:Nun ist der Berufsverkehr endgltig durch. Die S-Bahnen sind laut Martin Winterling nur noch sprlich besetzt - "zum Beispiel mit der Oma die mit ihren beiden Enkelinnen zur Wilhelma unterwegs ist".09.10 Uhr:Kollege Winterling meldet sich. "Um 9 Uhr ist Odyssee nach Grunbach zu Ende."Anschluss an die S-Bahn nach Schorndorf klappt. Aber aufgepasst: die S-Bahn fhrt heute ausnahmsweise von Gleis 1. Stndig muss ein Einweiser die Leute vom gewohnten Mittelgleis runterlotsen.9.08 Uhr:Ein Pendler klagt: Er sei um 7.14 Uhr ab Schorndorf mit dem Direktbus gefahren: Der Einweiser habe die Leute "reingepfercht", sodass bei der Fahrt ber die Bundesstrae nach Waiblingen etwa 25 bis 30 Leute keinen Sitzplatz gehabt htten, sondern stehen mussten. "Wenn da was passiert ..." Es habe sich um einen Gelenkbus, einen sogeannten Ziehharmonika-Bus gehandelt - whrend der Fahrt sei man sich im Stehen "vorgekommen wie auf dem Schiffsdeck. So geht's ja nicht", das sei aus Sicherheitsgrnden fragwrdig.Dazu sei die Route des Busses seltsam gewesen: Er habe den Waiblinger Bahnhof nicht ber die Ausfahrt Beinstein oder Waiblingen-Mitte angefahren, sondern den Weg ber B14/29-Teiler und Westumfahrung genimmen. Dadurch sei er in den gestauten Morgenpendlerverkehr vor dem Kappelbergtunnel Richtung Stuttgart geraten.09.07 Uhr:Laut Straenverkehrszentrale scheint der Verkehr rund um den Kappelbergtunnel wieder zu flieen. Damit sollten auch die Busse wieder zgiger durchkommen.09.04 Uhr: Zusatzinfo am Rande: Die dpa meldet gerade: " Bahnfahrer haben im Sdwesten hufiger mit verspteten Regionalzgen der Deutschen Bahn zu tun als im bundesweiten Durchschnitt."08.49 Uhr:Zwei Szenen von unterwegs:Am Bahnhof Schorndorf lief um 8 Uhr der Umstieg der Regionalexpress-Pendler aus Richtung Gmndin die in der Grabenstrae abfahrenden Direktbusse nach Waiblingen reibungslos, entspannt und zgig. Die Helfer in orangefarbenen Westen mussten nur wenigen Fahrgsten den Weg weisen. Hier also so weit alles zuversichtlich stimmend.Blick auf die Bundesstrae: Vor dem Kappelbergtunnel wurde der Verkehr Richtung Stuttgart um 8.30 Uhr etwa auf Hhe der Abzweigung Waiblingen Sd zhflssig mit Stautendenz. Nicht schn, aber um diese Zeit auch nicht wirklich auergewhnlich.08.47 Uhr:In Grunbach luft alles entspannt. Eine einteilige S-Bahn pendelt zwischen Schorndorf und Grunbach halbleer, die Anezige am Zug kann man da schon mal abschalten.08.41 Uhr: Auf der B29/14 ab Ausfahrt Waiblingen Sd Richtung Kappelbergtunnel ist mit mindestens zhem Verkehr zu rechnen. Kollege Schwarz meint: "Nicht schn, aber um diese Zeit auch nicht ungewhnlich. Fazit: Lage angespannt, aber kein Ausnahmezustand."08.38 Uhr:Peter Schwarz hat gute Nachrichten: In Schorndorf scheint der Umstieg der Pendler auf die Busse bisher reibungslos zu verlaufen: "Hier keine Probleme. Genug Helfer in orangefarbenen Westen und Wegweiser. Alles im grnen Bereich."08.34 Uhr:Kollege Winterling meldet sich aus dem Bus: Alle Busse mssen einen Umweg ber die Westumfahrung Richtung Schmiden fahren. Und damit direkt in den Stau vor dem Kappelbergtunnel.Sein Fazit: "Koordination zwischen Bahn und Strassenbauamt hat versagt. Wie am Wochenende bei Sperrung B29-Ausfahrt Beutelsbach."08.25 Uhr:Der P&R Parkplatz in Waiblingen ist jetzt voll. Ob das mit dem Tipp unseres Fotografen zu tun hat?Unser Reporter Martin Winterling steigt derweil in den Bus nach Grunbach. "Abenteuer Teil 2", nennt er das Unterfangen.08.22 Uhr: Waiblingen. Ein Geschftsmann ist vllig berrascht vom Ersatzverkehr. Seinen Termin in Aalen wird er nun statt um 9 Uhr wohl erst um 10.30 Uhr wahrnehmen knnen.08.19 Uhr:Unmut ber Umleitung eines Busses, dessen Fahrer wohl nicht ber die Sperrung der Waiblinger Strae in Rommenshausen informiert war. So ist der Bus etwas lnger unterwegs - und einige Fahrgste sauer.Whrenddessen erneut Verwirrung in Waiblingen: Die Fahrgste vermissen Schilder im Bahnhof, die darber informieren, wo der Ersatzverkehr losfhrt.08.07 Uhr:Unser Fotograf meldet sich mit einem Tipp per Whatsapp fr alle, die in Waiblingen auf Bus und Bahn umsteigen wollen: "P&R Parkhaus Waiblingen hat noch viele Pltze. Kennt ja auch kein Auswrtiger."08.05 Uhr: Verwirrung auf Gleis 5 am Waiblinger Bahnhof. Fahrgste stehen verunsichert an der S2 nach Stuttgart. Fhrt sie oder bleibt sie stehen? Sie bleibt stehen. Fr einen Umstieg auf die S3 ist es zu spt.An der Bushaltestelle am Ausgang Ameisenbhl ist es ruhig. Ein Einweiser hilft und holt Leute aus dem Direktbus nach Schorndorf, die nicht so weit fahren wollen.08.00 Uhr:Groer Andrang in Waiblingen. Whrend am Bahnsteig etliche Pendler einen Platz im Zug ergattern wollen ...... werden andere Fahgste zum Schienenersatzverkehr geleitet. Achtung: Die Busse fahren am Ausgang zum Ameisenbhl.07.30 Uhr:Die Zeichen fr einen reiblungslosen Berufsverkehr am Montagmorgen stehen schlecht. Das hat mehrere Grnde:Lesen Sie Ihre Zeitung immer und berall digital: Hier ePAPER-Angebote entdecken! SectionsOne missing crew is frantically being searched using sea-air coordinated method.

Advertisement ................................................................ Advertisement ................................................................ Advertisement ................................Luxemburg - Die heftig umstrittene Reform des EU-Urheberrechts ist endgltig beschlossen. In der letzten Abstimmung zu diesem Gesetz stimmten die EU-Staaten dem Vorhaben am Montag mehrheitlich zu. Auch die deutsche Bundesregierung votierte mit einem Ja - allerdings mit Vorbehalten.Damit ist der Weg fr die Reform nun frei. Zuvor hatte das Europarlament das Vorhaben bereits gebilligt. Die EU-Lnder haben nun rund zwei Jahre Zeit, die neuen Regeln in nationales Recht umzusetzen.Nachdem es vor allem in Deutschland heftigen Protest gegen Artikel 13 der Reform (im finalen Text Artikel 17) gab, betonte die Bundesregierung zuletzt, Uploadfilter sollten bei der Umsetzung weitgehend vermieden werden. Gemeint sind Programme, die geschtzte Inhalte schon beim Hochladen ins Internet erkennen und aussortieren.Kritiker frchten, dass die Filter zu viel blocken und warnen vor Zensur. Bis zum Sonntagabend arbeitete die Bundesregierung deshalb an einer Zusatzerklrung, die die deutsche Lesart der Reform klarstellen soll. "Ziel muss sein, das Instrument "Uploadfilter" weitgehend unntig zu machen", heit es darin. Die Copyright-Reform soll das veraltete Urheberrecht in der EU ans digitale Zeitalter anpassen und Urhebern fr ihre Inhalte im Netz eine bessere Vergtung sichern. Mitte Februar hatten sich Unterhndler des Europaparlaments und der EU-Staaten auf einen Kompromiss geeinigt. Diesen hatte das Europaparlament Ende Mrz gebilligt. Die Zustimmung der EU-Staaten vom Montag ist nun der letzte Schritt, damit die Reform in Krze in Kraft treten kann.Die Mehrheit war jedoch knapp. Htte Deutschland sich enthalten oder gegen das Vorhaben gestimmt, wre es nicht zustande gekommen. Denn die Niederlande, Luxemburg, Polen, Italien, Finnland und Schweden stimmten dagegen. Belgien, Estland und Slowenien enthielten sich.Die Bundesregierung reagierte hingegen mit der vierseitigen Zusatzerklrung auf Protest. "Upload-Plattformen sollen auch knftig als freie, unzensierte Kommunikationskanle fr die Zivilgesellschaft zur Verfgung stehen", heit es darin. Falls doch technische Lsungen eingesetzt werden, solle die EU die Entwicklung von frei zugnglichen Technologien mit offenen Schnittstellen frdern. Zudem trifft die fragliche Regelung aus Sicht der Bundesregierung nur auf mchtige Plattformen wie YouTube oder Facebook zu. Man gehe davon aus, dass eine EU-weit einheitliche Umsetzung vereinbart werde. Falls die neuen Regeln doch die Meinungsfreiheit einschrnken oder gegen EU-Recht verstoen sollten, msse die Reform korrigiert werden.Die Kritiker lieen sich von der deutschen Zusatzerklrung nicht beeindrucken. FDP-Chef Christian Lindner schrieb auf Twitter, die groe Koalition habe ihre letzte Chance, Uploadfilter zu verhindern, nicht genutzt. Der Grnen-Spitzenkandidat fr die Europawahl, Sven Giegold, kritisierte die Zusatzerklrung als "fragwrdige Kosmetik". Und Piraten-Politikerin Julia Reda, die eine der schrfsten Kritikerinnen des Vorhabens im Europaparlament war, sagte: "Das neue Urheberrecht macht alle zu Verlierern." EU-Kommissionschef Jean-Claude Juncker bezeichnete die Reform auf Twitter hingegen als fehlendes Puzzleteil des digitalen Binnenmarkts in der EU. hnlich uerte sich Kulturstaatsministerin Monika Grtters (CDU).Auch umstritten war Artikel 11 (im finalen Text Artikel 15), der ein Leistungsschutzrecht fr Presseverlage vorsieht. Danach mssen Nachrichten-Suchmaschinen wie Google News fr das Anzeigen von Artikel-Ausschnitten knftig Geld an die Verlage zahlen. Hier sehen Kritiker insbesondere fr kleine Verlage Nachteile, die gegenber Google eine schwache Verhandlungsposition htten. Zudem verweisen sie auf Deutschland, wo es ein Leistungsschutzrecht schon seit 2013 gibt, das aber nicht zu nennenswerten Geldzahlungen an die Verlage fhrt. Die groen deutschen Verlegerverbnde begrten die Reform jedoch.Lesen Sie Ihre Zeitung immer und berall digital: Hier ePAPER-Angebote entdecken!

    Carson Wentz met with the media after the Eagles opened their voluntary offseason workout program Monday.
    Martin Frank, The News JournalPHILADELPHIA Carson Wentz didn't seem worried that the stress fracture in his back is still not fully healed, more than four months after the Eagles quarterback sat out the final three regular season games and two playoff games.But Wentz said Monday that he would not commit to being ready to participate when the on-field practices begin May 21. The Eagles, like most NFL teams, began their organized team activities Monday with strength and conditioning exercises that will continue over the next two weeks.All of the workouts and OTA practices are voluntary."Thats the goal, but theres really no timetable, no rush," Wentz said about the OTA practices next month. "But I feel good with the progression Ive been on."From looking at phone to criticizing booing fans, Sixers embarrass themselves in loss to NetsBut Wentz did confirm that his back isn't fully healed yet. In December, when Wentz first was sidelined, Eagles head coach Doug Pederson estimated that it could take three months to fully heal."Its still getting there," Wentz said. "Some of the stuff just takes time, but thats not the main concern. Its just kind of how I feel and were pretty good with where Im at."Right now, were kind of taking it week by week. Im throwing some, Im running some and kind of taking it week by week. Feel good."Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz (11) throws before an NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys, in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Dec. 9, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)(Photo: Michael Ainsworth, AP)Wentz didn't want to delve into specifics about his injury or his rehab.But his back was obviously bothering him for several weeks during the season before he was shut down. This came after he spent all of last season rehabbing from a torn ACL and LCL, a process that kept him out until Week 3 last season.Eagles tight end Zach Ertz said Monday that Wentz was playing through "a broken back" for at least a few weeks. He later said that he might have "over-spoke" about that."Obviously hes been one of the most dynamic players in the league when hes healthy," Ertz said. "Was he 100 percent last year? Absolutely not. The guy had a broken back early in the year. We dont  I dont know if he knows exactly when it happened or whatnot. But hes just trying to prove to be he can be the best QB he can be for this organization."Eagles' Jalen Mills arrested after fight with Washington Wizards playerThat, Wentz said, is his goal. He said he's excited both for his future, especially in proving that he can stay healthy after suffering serious injuries in each of the last two seasons.The Eagles, of course, had Nick Foles as the backup then. Folesled the Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl victory when Wentz hurt his knee in Dec. 2017, and to four straight wins after taking over last season.Eagles-Nick Foles matchup set; team signs a quarterbackAfter the season, the Eaglesreconfirmed Wentz's status as the franchise quarterback by letting Foles leave as a free agent."Obviously, it isdifferent (without Foles)," Wentz said. "I love the heck out of him ... But thats football. Theres always turnover. And hes got an exciting opportunity ahead of him as well."Wentz is eligible for a contract extension either this offseason or next. Wentz wouldn't say if he's willing to get the extension done in the next few months, or wait until after this season."I love it here. I love this city. I love the fans here," he said. "But the specifics of all that, Im not going to dive into them. My agent will handle all of that fun stuff."If Wentz stays healthy and has an MVP caliber year as he did before his knee injury in Dec. 2017, he will be able to command a bigger contract next offseason. Wentz, for one, said he needs to prove that he can stay healthy.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. "I want to get healthy and put everything behind me," Wentz said.Added Ertz: "I know hes extremely motivated to be the best quarterback he can be. Two years ago he was playing at an MVP level. He probably should have won the MVP that year even though he missed the last couple games. He really did build the foundation of this team."That year when we were so successful he was the reason why we got the first round bye. So Im sure his goals are to be even better than that."The Eagles did all that they could to help Wentz.Theyadded a much-needed speed receiver in DeSean Jackson and a potential lead running back in Jordan Howard. Both players were acquired in trades Jackson, the former Eagle from 2008-14, from Tampa Bay, and Howard from the Chicago Bears.On the 32-year-old Jackson, Wentz said: "Its exciting, without a doubt. You see the guy, and obviously hes getting up there in his age, but he stills run like the wind. Hes impressive on film ... The guys still got it."I think hell bring a dynamic aspect to our offense. Whether hes catching balls during the game or opening things up underneath, Im really excited to have him."But mostly, Wentz is excited to get started again. Even if he needs more time for his back to heal, the rehab process won't be nearly as intense as it was last spring with his knee.Perhaps that's why Wentz said the beginning of the offseason program Monday felt like"the first day of school."Contact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

    Damian Giletto, The News JournalThe ACLU of Delaware is looking for new leadership following the retirement announcement of Executive Director Kathleen MacRae effective Monday.Until her position is filled,David Bever who has served as the organization's director of developmentsince 2016  will take on the role of interim director.MacRae's departure comes after eight years of leading the ACLU of Delaware through lawsuits, legislationand education efforts. Now, she's heading to Florida to enjoy retirement in the sunshine, according to the organization.Kathleen MacRae, then the Executive Director of the ACLU of Delaware, speaks during a rally in Wilmington, Feb. 2010.(Photo: Damian Giletto/The News Journal)Because our organization is so strong both in talented staff and finances, I believe that the time is right to turn the work over to new leadership that can steer this organization to even greater heights," MacRae said in a statement.The ACLU of Delaware is known for challenging issues that include criminal justice reform, LGBT equality, prisoner rights and First Amendment protections, all of which MacRae has influenced during her time with the organization.Opinion: Don't send prisoners out of state, reduce the prison populationMost recently, the ACLU filed a landmark lawsuit against the state Department of Education last year over how it funds education, with the argument that the system gives more support to affluent children than those living in poverty.Kathleen MacRae, executive director of ACLU Delaware speaks during a press conference concerning a lawsuit challenging the state's allocation of resources to schools in 2018.(Photo: Jason Minto, The News Journal)"For too long children from low-income families, students whose first language is not English, and children with disabilities have been left behind," MacRae said at a press conference announcing the lawsuit. "Every child deserves a chance to succeed. All students have a right to an education that prepares them adequately for college and the world of work."Before coming to Delaware, MacRae worked as thedevelopment director at the ACLU of New Mexico, where she was the executive director of the New Mexico Coalition to Repeal the Death Penalty. Her efforts were successful in March 2009, when after a 10-effort, the death penalty was repealed.In Delaware, her latest efforts have gone toward cutting Delaware's prison population in half as part of the Smart Justice campaign.David Bever will serve as the interim director of the ACLU of Delaware until the organization officially fills the position.(Photo: Courtesy of the ACLU of Delaware)"Kathleen has a unique passion for social justice and has been tireless in advocating for the people of Delaware, said Kathryn Jakabcin, president of the ACLU of Delaware.Bever, who will serve as the interim directorwhile the organization looks to fill the position, previously led two Pennsylvania nonprofit victim service agencies.After leading the ACLU of Delaware for more than eight years, Kathleen MacRae, Executive Director, has announced her retirement.

                Aktualisiert: 15.04.19 17:24Wanderer vermuten Glle-SauereiEin Traktorfahrer entleert sein Odelfass im Langen-Kchel-See, der vom Naturschutzgebiet Murnauer Moos umgeben wird: Dieser Eindruck drngte sich Wanderern auf. Die Ermittlungen von Polizei und Landratsamt laufen. Ein Umwelt-Skandal? Nur vielleicht.Eschenlohe  Gerd L. zieht es immer wieder ins Murnauer Moos: Ein wunderschnes Naturschutzgebiet, schwrmt der Garmisch-Partenkirchner. Aktuell blhe unter anderem der Brlauch, das ist wunderbar anzuschauen. In das idyllische Bild schob sich zuletzt eine mindestens fragwrdige Szene. L. und seine Lebensgefhrtin Sibylle W. parkten am vergangenen Freitag an der Verbindungsstrae zwischen Eschenlohe und Grafenaschau, wanderten ins Moos. Gegen 10 Uhr berholte sie ein grnlackierter Bulldog, der auf seinem Anhnger ein Odelfass transportierte. Aus etwa 100 Metern Entfernung sahen L. und W., wie der Traktorfahrer rckwrts mit dem Anhnger erst an und dann ein Stck in den langgezogenen See neben der Kantine des frheren Hartsteinwerks  also den Langen Kchel  rangierte. Sie hrten eine Pumpe, dann kam der Bulldog zurck. Als das Paar das Ufer erreichte, sah es nach Angaben von L. die ganze Brhe im Wasser  das muss Odel gewesen sein. Eine Unverschmtheit.Der Nachweis dafr, dass ein Unbekannter wirklich Glle wild entsorgt hat, fehlt bisher. Was genau vorgefallen ist, muss erst noch herausgefunden werden, sagt Landratsamts-Sprecher Stephan Scharf. Der ehemalige Steinbruch liege nicht im Naturschutzgebiet, wird aber davon umsumt. Und grundstzlich gilt: Glle, die in die Gewsser kommt, fhrt zu einer Schdigung der Flora und Fauna, nicht nur im unmittelbar betroffenen Gewsser, sondern auch in der Vegetation der umgebenden Moorflchen und dem Grundwasser. Das Landratsamt ermittelt nun ebenso wie die Murnauer Polizei, die prft, ob ein Umwelt-Delikt vorliegt. Wirklich extreme Frevel kommen nach Angaben von Dienstgruppenleiter Thomas Leinauer in diesem Schutzgebiet praktisch nicht vor, fr das strenge Regeln gelten. Vielleicht, meint Leinauer, habe jemand nur Wasser eingesaugt, um das Fass zu reinigen, und die Flssigkeit auf einer dafr geeigneten Flche entsorgt. Wrde man es vor Ort durchsplen, wre das in Leinauers Augen grob.Das kann sich Axel Doering indes noch eher vorstellen als den Fall, dass jemand wirklich einen Odelbehlter entleert hat. Wahrscheinlich wurde das Fass gewaschen, sagt der Kreisvorsitzende des Bund Naturschutz. Aber auch das wre eine Sauerei. Die Nhrstoffe der Glle brchten das System aus dem Gleichgewicht, schdigten Tiere und Pflanzen. Das geht berhaupt nicht.Die identischen Worte whlt Eschenlohes Ortsobmann des Bayerischen Bauernverbands: Das geht berhaupt nicht. Glle, sagt Jakob Schnach, habe im Wasser nichts verloren. Ihn irritiert die Frage nach dem Warum: Was fr einen Grund gbe es, Odel wild in dem Gewsser zu entsorgen, obwohl dieser jetzt normal ausgebracht werden kann? Ich gehe davon aus, dass meine Kollegen verantwortungsbewusst handeln. Alles andere wre eine Katastrophe. Schnach nimmt die Sache ernst, will auf den Fall in der Jahreshauptversammlung des Alm- und Weidevereins Eschenlohe am Dienstagabend hinweisen. Er kann sich einen Reim darauf machen, wie es zu der Szene gekommen sein knnte, die L. und W. beobachtet haben  und liefert eine weitaus harmlosere mgliche Erklrung. Ein Landwirt, der Glle ausgefahren habe und sein Fass reinigen mchte, saugt Schnachs Worten nach in der Regel Wasser aus einem Bach in den schmutzigen Behlter und bringt das Gemisch auf eigenen Wiesen wieder aus. Wird der Schlauch nach dem Absaugen abgekoppelt, befinden sich darin noch mehrere Meter Wassersule, die dann zurck ins Gewsser laufen. So knnte man eine Trbung erklren, sagt Schnach.Der Unteren Naturschutzbehrde ist bisher kein Fall bekannt, in dem im Moos Gllefsser geleert oder gereinigt wurden. Es gibt kaum Vergehen, die in Form von Strafverfahren oder Ordnungswidrigkeiten geahndet werden mssen, sagt Scharf. Die Landwirte kennen die zu beachtenden Regelungen sehr gut und stimmen sich im Regelfall auch mit dem Landratsamt ab.Die Behrde wird nun wie die Polizei versuchen, einen Verursacher zu ermitteln und festzustellen, was genau vorgefallen ist. Eventuell gebe es andere Erklrungen als eine Entsorgung oder Reinigung eines Gllefasses, sagt auch Scharf. Er fgt an: Die Rampe wird auf alle Flle durch bauliche Manahmen unbefahrbar gemacht, so dass eine Wiederholung ausgeschlossen ist.Auch interessant: Im Murnauer Moos luft eine Studie -Dem Braunkehlchen-Mysterium auf der SpurLesen Sie auch: rger um Frevel im Naturschutzgebiet Murnauer MoosPasswort vergessen?Jetzt registrierenDie mit Stern (*) markierten Felder sind Pflichtfelder.Hi Already a subscriber?Already a print edition subscriber, but don't have a login?Manage your account settings.View the E-NewspaperManage your NewslettersLog OutGet the newsLet friends in your social network know what you are reading aboutFumiko Suzuki Wickeremasuriya, also known as "Suzie," "Baba,"of Dededo, diedApril 2at the age of 77.A link has been sent to your friend's email address.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

April ber eine Kleinanzeigenplattform einen Gutschein ber 500 Euro verkauft. Der Kufer tuschte dem Dachauer eine angeblich durchgefhrte berweisung vor, wie Stefan Reichenbcher, Polizeioberkommissar der Ermittlungsgruppe Cybercrime, gestern mittelte. Infolgedessen bermittelte der Dachauer den Zahlencode des Gutscheins per E-Mail. Der Dachauer erhielt jedoch nie das vereinbarte Geld. Die Ermittlungen ber das Gutscheinportal ergaben Hinweise, dass die Internetbetrger mit dem Gutschein eine Hotelreservierung in Bremen durchfhrten, so Reichenbcher. Die Dachauer Polizei informierte ihre Kollegen in Bremen, die die mutmalichen Betrger am Wochenende in dem Hotel festnahmen: den 18- und einen 19-Jhrigen aus Bremen.

Grote onzin!Zo druk is het dit Paasweekend op SchipholPensioenkorting is nog te voorkomenLuchtvaart-rapport is net een links partijprogrammaCommerzbank is stokoude, zieke manBizarre straf na verkeersovertredingAgressieve vrouw op heterdaad betraptGeheim wapen tegen zware jongensVechtmachine slaat Rotterdammer zomaar knock-outLeerlingen vallen pastoor aan (om bizarre reden)His body language, thunderous appeal, long beard and wavy hair lit up the entire atmosphere. The charismatic South African leg spinner Imran Tahir adds flavor to the IPL tournament like nobody else can. But Tahir is not just about the flair. His combative style, gestures and trademark grin often camouflage his killer instinct, as has been seen several times in IPL 2019. Tahir is like the character 'Po' in the famous Kung Fu Panda movies, who always wants to fight to the finish. No other spinner in the IPL entertains the audience the way Tahir does - with his skills, determination and charisma all at the same time.Tahir grabbed four crucial wickets of Chris Lynn, Nitish Rana, Robin Uthappa and Andre Russell for 27 runs in the CSK vs KKR match to twist the proceedings in CSKs favor. Lynn in particular looked unstoppable at one point as he was raining fours and sixes at will, and he scored 82 off 51 balls before he fell to Tahirs leg spin. When Russell was out for 10, Tahir ran all around the field while spreading his hands like the wings of a fighter plane. He had demolished the strong batting line-up of the Kolkota Knight Riders, setting the game up nicely for CSK. Tahirs enthusiastic celebrations often outshine his bowling. And that often irritates the opposition players; a furious Russell chopped off the plants in front of the dressing room with his bat, much to the amusement of Tahir. Dhoni told me where to pitch the leg spin, he said later.Tahir has plenty of guile and bite in his variations, particularly the googly. Many top order batsmen fumble against his bowling; a majority of them are forced to step out to take the ball as a half volley. Tahir often creates panic in the middle order with his accuracy and clever line and length. His neat action helps him hide his googly well too.The only way to deal with Tahir is to get him out of the attack. A few batsmen can lift him out of the ground, but it's a high-risk strategy at the best of times. Tahir has bagged 13 wickets in eight matches this season with an economy rate of 5.76. He is second in the IPL Purple Cap list, and has helped CSK maintain a stronghold over the top position in the points table.One of the most underutilized and misused Superstar on the current roster has to be Shinsuke Nakamura. Although, a former US Champion and winner of the Royal Rumble, it would be safe to say that Nakamura has not been used to his full potential in WWE.There had been a lot of speculation regarding Nakamura's future in the WWE, as it was alleged that The Rockstar is not happy with his state in WWE and may not re-sign his contract when it is up.However, as per recent reports, the truth seems entirely different.Shinsuke Nakamura started his pro-wrestling career in 2002 in Japan. He rose through the ranks in Japan and finally captured the coveted IWGP World Championship in NJPW. He also held various other championships like the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and IWGP Tag Team Championships during his stay in NJPW.The Artist made his debut in WWE as part of NXT in 2016, and was able to capture the NXT Championship as well.However, his run on the main roster has been sub-par, and even though he has had a series of great matches, the 39-year-old has failed to break through.Also Read: When former WWE Champion physically attacked Vince McMahon on a flightWhile there was speculation that Nakamura may be planning to jump ship and join AEW, those rumors may not hold any truth.Dave Meltzer responded to a fan asking if Shinsuke was staying with WWE or leaving, and Meltzer stated that he is staying.Staying https://t.co/RRFw24I3T8Shinsuke Nakamura is currently paired with Rusev on SmackDown and the two have become an important part of the Tag Team division.Do you think it is wise for Nakamura to continue with WWE?Also Read: WWE adds a major stipulation in The Undertaker's new contractLiverpool beat Chelsea 2-0 in a crucial Premier League match yesterday. Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah both scored goals in the second half of the match after the first half ended goalless, to take their team home.Liverpool now lead the league table with 85 points from 34 matches, ahead of their nearest rivals Manchester City by two points. However, City have a game in hand, and the title race promises to go down to the wire.Chelsea remain on 66 points from 34 matches, and would have to struggle their way into the top 4. They have now lost to Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool in the second half of the Premier League. Liverpool, on the other hand, have now beaten Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham in the same period.There were some players who excelled for Liverpool yesterday. Here, we take a look at 3 such players:Yesterdays match was yet another indication that Salah has overcome his recent lean patch. He played nine games without scoring for Liverpool, but has now scored in both of their last two league matches.Salah played his part in Liverpools first goal too, as the goal resulted from his one-two with one of his teammates. His penetrating run into the Chelsea penalty box led to the first goal.Moreover, the second goal he scored was a thing of beauty, as his rasping left-footed shot from 25 yards out gave no chance to the Chelsea goalie. It was one of the finest goals scored this season, and Salah now has 22 goals in 44 matches.Salah was a constant threat through the right flank yesterday, and kept cutting in frequently. His return to form is undoubtedly great news to all the Liverpool supporters; he will be absolutely crucial to his team's chances as they look to fend off City towards the home stretch.The 15-member Indian squad for the World Cup, on paper at least, seems to be a balanced one. It may be light on pace bowlers, but the selection of two pace-bowling all-rounders in Hardik Pandya and Vijay Shankar gives it some cover on that front.Similarly, it has three spinners one of whom can be seen as a genuine all-rounder, apart from a middle order batsman in Kedar Jadhav who can be a useful spinning option, when the conditions suit slow bowling.Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan are the tried and tested opening pair and despite the latters lack of performances in his last few ODI matches, there was no pressing reason to go with any other combination. However, the selectors have been quite prudent in their selection of KL Rahul as a possible third opener, in case either of the first choice openers faces some injury scare or lack of form.Though there may be some justifiable disappointment for Ambati Rayudu who may rightfully consider himself unlucky after missing out on selection, the fact of the matter is that the other middle order batsmen in the squad bring something extra to the table. KL Rahul, apart from being a possible contender for a middle order batting slot, can also be a genuine reserve opener.Dinesh Karthik, apart from being a possible number four, can also be seen as a finisher. He is also the teams reserve wicket keeper. Kedar Jadhav is not just an unorthodox, yet intelligent batsman, but also a more than decent spin bowling option.Vijay Shankar is possibly the most improved Indian player in the last few months. He seems to have peaked at the right moment. His batting, especially, has improved by leaps and bounds. He can certainly be seen as a hard-hitting middle order batsman. His medium pace bowling and brilliant fielding skills are added values that he brings to the them.All in all, kudos to the selectors and the Indian captain for selecting a squad that seems to have all bases covered for a successful World Cup campaign.It was late last year that The Undertaker suddenly removed several references to WWE from all of his social media accounts and begun to take on some appearances outside of WWE, where he would not be directly representing the company.The Undertaker was first announced to be participating in a tour of the UK in May with the leading UK Q&A tour company with wrestlers, Inside the Ropes. Taker was to take part in a meet and greet with fans and do an hour + long Q&A session. Taker was then announced to be appearing at the first annual Monopoly Events convention 'For The Love of Wrestling', that will take place in Liverpool, England on April 27 and 28. The 'Phenom' was then announced for the Starrcast II convention taking place on the same weekend and location as All Elite Wrestling's Double or Nothing pay-per-view debut.The Undertaker's appearance was said to have caught the attention of Vince McMahon, who wasn't pleased. Dave Meltzer has since reported that The Undertaker has pushed hard to keep his three upcoming appearances, but due to his new contract, will not be taking anymore appearances outside of WWE. The Undertaker's Q&A portions of his appearances have all been nixed due to his new deal, but did manage to maintain his meet and greet autograph and photo shoot opportunities with the fans.I recently asked the owner of Monopoly Events and For The Love of Wrestling Andy Kleek, about The Undertaker appearing at his event and he said,''We are honored and proud to be having The Undertaker for his first and potentially last time in the UK and Europe. It has been a mammoth operation just to deliver this booking to you, with complex contract negotiations and behind the scene work. I would like to thank the WWE for giving us this opportunity, we are all looking forward to meeting Mark and enjoying our time with this superstar of sport. ''While The Undertaker's Q&A session had to be pulled from the event, Mr. Kleek is still overjoyed to have maintained The Undertaker's last ever UK/European appearance and to even have managed to book him for both days of his event, when The Undertaker had only been originally available for one day. The Undertaker will be appearing all weekend long at Monopoly Events For The Love of Wrestling at the Exhibition Centre in Liverpool. The Undertaker will charge 150.00 per photo, 150.00 per standard autograph and 200.00 per Premium item.The Undertaker will then appear in Manchester, London and Glasgow, Scotland, with Inside The Ropes on April 29, 30 and May 1, but the Q&A session of their shows will now be occupied by WWE Hall of Famer Mick Foley. The Undertaker will also still be appearing at Starrcast II later in May in Las Vegas.The Undertaker will still be making these kinds of appearances in the future, but they will all be under the WWE banner and at WWE exclusive events such as WWE Axxess during the WrestleMania weekends. These may very well be your only ever opportunity to meet and greet The Undertaker in the UK.WINDHOEK  Brave Warriors pair of the foreign legion Peter Pikes Shalulile and Deon Hotto-Kavendjii were both in devastating form, scoring match-winning goals for their respective clubs Highlands Park and Bidvest Wits University in the stinking rich South African Professional Soccer League (PSL) last weekend.Shalulile netted the only goal of the match as the Lions of the North dispatched relegation candidates Maritzburg United by a solitary goal on Saturday. Utility fullback Denzil Haoseb was named amongst the substitutes.

Theyre like friends you might chat with. The wrentit and the Aberts towhee are like the neighbors you dont talk to much. As for the Hammonds flycatcher and the Brewers sparrow, Americans dont care much about them at all.Thats the word from a new study that aimed to define a range of relationships between people and birds across the United States, said Justin Schuetz, one of the authors.Results appear in a paper released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Schuetz, a biologist and independent researcher in Bath, Maine, did the work with Alison Johnston, whos affiliated with Cornell University in Ithaca, New YorkThe project included studying Google searches performed from 2008 to 2017 to learn about what Americans think about 621 bird species. Researchers knew where each search came from. They also knew the natural range of each species and how often it is sighted in specific places, based on a national database.One key question was whether the Google data revealed more interest in each species than one would expect in various locations, based on how often it is sighted in those places. Another question was how much the interest in each species was limited to its natural range, or spilled out beyond it.So birds in the celebrity category are those that attracted more Google attention than one would expect from how often theyre seen, and whose popularity extended outside of their natural range. They have a reputation beyond where they live, Schuetz explained.Next came the friends or enemies category, which included species that get more Google attention than expected, but mostly in the states where they live. As with the other categories, the researchers couldnt tell whether the searchers opinions of these familiar birds were positive or negative.Then came birds classified as neighbors, whose few Google searches were confined to where they live. Finally there were the strangers, birds that got little Google interest anywhere.The research also turned up other insights into what makes a species popular. Bigger bodies, colorful plumage and regular visits to birdfeeders helped. Species that served as mascots for professional sports teams reached celebrity status, but it wasnt clear whether being a mascot encouraged popularity or the other way around.The results also turned up some surprises. People seem to have an inordinate fascination with owls we couldnt account for entirely in our analysis, Schuetz said.Jeffrey Gordon, president of the American Birding Association, called the study a fascinating framework for trying to understand how people are relating to birds.I hope theyre able to use it to help people appreciate whats right in their own backyard, he said. Most of us just arent keyed in to what is literally at our doorstep.David Ringer, chief network officer for the National Audubon Society, also found the work interesting.Its great to see how much we know and love some species, and its provocative to see how much we still have to discover, he wrote in an email. I hope that many bird strangers will become friends, and neighbors will turn into celebrities.'___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education. The AP is solely responsible for all content.There is very little science behind most of the health claims made for CBD, the cannabis product turning up in cosmetics, foods and dietary supplements.With mainstream retailers Walgreens and CVS offering CBD skin products, its easy to believe there must be something special about the trendy ingredient. But the claims are largely unproven, quality control standards dont exist and the legal status of CBD-infused food is in doubt.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to hold a public hearing May 31 to gather more information on the science, manufacturing and sale of cannabis compounds such as CBD.A look at what we know as U.S. regulators work out what will and wont be allowed:WHAT IS CBD?CBD is one of more than 100 compounds found in marijuana. Its extracted using alcohol or carbon dioxide in factories. Its added to oils, mixed into creams and lotions and sold in candies and liquid drops.Widely sold online, CBD now is going mainstream. Prices range from $12 to $150 an ounce at high-end shops.CBD often comes from a cannabis plant known as hemp, which is defined by the U.S. government as having less than 0.3% THC. Thats important because THC is what causes marijuanas mind-altering effect.CBD doesnt get people high, although it may be calming. Keep in mind some CBD products may contain THC, whether or not the label says so.People drug tested for work, addiction programs or because they take prescription opioids should take note: CBD products have caused people to fail urine drug screens.IS IT A MIRACLE CURE?If you believe the hype, CBD treats pain, relieves anxiety and both helps you sleep and keeps you focused.Most claims are based on studies in rats, mice or in test tubes. Some human research has been done, but in small numbers of people.One exception: For two rare seizure disorders, the evidence for CBD was strong enough to convince the FDA to approve GW Pharmaceuticals drug Epidiolex, which contains a purified form.The FDA has sent warning letters to companies marketing products with claims for CBDs effects on cancer, Alzheimers disease, fibromyalgia and drug addiction.Only drugs that have been reviewed by the FDA as safe and effective can make claims that they treat or prevent diseases or medical conditions. Many CBD producers attempt to sidestep the issue by using only vague language about general health and well-being.ANY SIDE EFFECTS?Scant research means not much is known about side effects either. In epilepsy research, CBD changed the way the body processed other drugs. That suggests CBD could interact with medications in ways we still dont know about.The most common side effects of the CBD drug Epidiolex include sleepiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea, increases in liver enzymes, exhaustion, rash and infections. The potential for liver injury and other risks can be handled with medical supervision, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said earlier this month, but less is known about how that would be managed without oversight. And there are questions about overlap if multiple CBD products are used.IS IT LEGAL?For now, the FDA has said CBD is not allowed as an ingredient in food, drinks or dietary supplements.In stating its position, the FDA cited a provision of the law prohibiting food makers from using active drug ingredients or those still undergoing substantial research. But the agency doesnt have the resources to police all the CBD products that are already available, said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA official.Theyre not going to pull a thousand products from the market, he said.The FDAs authority is over interstate commerce, and local officials have taken differing approaches. In New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, officials are warning eateries to stop selling it in food and drinks. Maine passed a law allowing it in foods and other products in the state.Skin creams and cosmetics may be on safer footing with the FDA, but that too remains uncertain, said Camille Gourdet of RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in Durham, North Carolina. Though cosmetics arent subject to premarket approval by the FDA, they could run afoul of regulations if they make specific health claims.Marijuana itself is illegal under federal law; most states that have legalized it allow marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles.ARE CBD LABELS ACCURATE?What you buy may contain much less CBD than the label states  or much more. It may include more THC than you want and it may be contaminated with mold or pesticides. Ask to see testing reports.A 2017 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found 70% of CBD products were mislabeled. Researchers used an independent lab to test 84 products from 31 companies.Youre really flying by the seat of your pants when you buy this stuff, said author Marcel Bonn-Miller of University of Pennsylvania.A product labeled as containing 100 milligrams of CBD may only have 5 milligrams or it may have 200, said Bonn-Miller, now an adviser for a company that sells CBD and other cannabis products. He did not work in the industry when he did the research.I wouldnt trust any of it until I knew independently it was safe, Bonn-Miller said.WHATS AHEAD?CBD research is planned or underway for cancer, autism, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, alcoholism with PTSD and psychiatric conditions. Results will take years, but some people arent waiting.They are vulnerable and really hoping to feel better, said Karen Hande, a nurse practitioner at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville.She became an expert in CBD because so many of her cancer patients were trying it. She tells them the evidence isnt enough to back the claims, but they want to believe something is going to work.___Follow APs complete marijuana coverage: https://apnews.com/Marijuana___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

Visiting Eleven Arrows came from a goal down to hold title-chasing African Stars to a 1-all draw under floodlights at the Sam Nujoma stadium on Friday evening.The Reds finished the match with a man down following the late dismissal of utility fullback Dennis Law Tjetjinda.
Starlile started off brightly but the usually clinical serial dangerous Comoros import Youssouf Ibroihim, missed a glorious opportunity to put the hosts ahead when he uncharacteristically missed a simple tap-in from close range.As the match wore on, Arrows grew in confidence and came close to opening their account through Anthony Kham.
Nonetheless, it was Bobby Samarias charges that took a well-deserved lead when Zimbabwean striker Crispen Mbewes shot was brilliantly parried away for a corner kick by compatriot Tinashe Dzambara in Arrows goal.From the resultant set piece, Kaka Nekundi put his team into the lead via a flashing header. The second half was a different ball game, as the visitors dominated play in the middle of the park, enjoying the lions share of ball possession.
However, the first real chance in the second half fell to Ibroihim whose shot was punched directly on the path of Stars lurking substitute Kumbee Katjiteo, but the gangling forwards tame effort was also tipped over the crossbar for a corner kick.In the 56th minute, Arrows had a penalty appeal chalked off by the referee as they pushed hard for the elusive equaliser.
Aprocius Petrus of Arrows missed the target by a few centimetres from a free kick at the edge of the penalty box. With the pressure mounting, the hosts were dealt a severe blow when veteran skipper Dennis Law Ngueza Tjetjinda fell foul of the referees crime sheet for dissent.Sensing defeat, the visitors made full use of their numerical advantage pushing forward in numbers to salvage a point against their 10-man opponents.Arrows were eventually rewarded when substitute Patrick Naweb brought the teams on level terms with a headed goal in the dying minutes of the match  94th minute. Final score: Stars 1-1 Arrows.In other league action, MTC Premiership table toppers Black Africa returned to winning ways with a comprehensive 3-0 victory over out-of-sorts Blue Waters to open a six-point gulf at the summit.
Gerald Goagoseb, McCartney Beatle Nowaseb and Denver Meyer were on target for the resurgent Gemengde outfit. Wire Shipangas wounded soldiers charges now seat on 41 points, with African Stars tailing in second spot six points off the pace (35) after 17 rounds of matches.In the weekends other league matches, league returnees Julinho Sporting dispatched relegation-threatened Civics by two unanswered goals (2-0). Young Brazilians and the visiting Mighty Gunners cancelled each other out in a 1-all stalemate at the Karasburg sports ground.Life Fighters failed to manufacture a decent result when Kahirona fell prey to Young Brazilians silky style of football philosophy as the leg-weary Northerns went down 3-4 in a 7-goal thriller in Karasburg yesterday.

State officials will challenge a court ruling that revoked the water permit for a silver and copper mine proposed beneath a Montana wilderness area, a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation spokesman said Monday.Judge Kathy Seeley ruled state officials didnt adequately consider potential damage to nearby streams from Hecla Mining Co.s Rock Creek Mine northeast of Noxon.Attorneys for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation plan to file an appeal, said agency spokesman John Grassy. He declined to offer further details.The April 9 ruling does not affect the ability of Idaho-based Hecla to conduct exploratory work for the mine, which the U.S. Forest Service gave preliminary approval to last year, company spokesman Luke Russell said Monday.Environmental groups represented by Earthjustice had argued that streams within the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness are so ecologically valuable that they deserve the greatest protections available under law.Seeley agreed and in her April 9 order sent the matter back to the Department of Natural Resources Conservation for reconsideration.Its great news for wilderness, rivers and streams the critical habitat they provide for fish and wildlife, said Bonnie Gestring with Earthworks, one of the groups that challenged the water permit after it was issued in January 2018.Rock Creek would employ about 300 people and cover almost 500 acres.Montana regulators in a separate case have asked a judge to block Hecla CEO Phillips Baker, Jr. from exploring or opening new mines. They allege hes in violation of the states bad actor law because of ongoing pollution from a mining company where Baker once worked.Grimsby defeats Exeter in six games
Exeter Hawks forward Jon Baker reaches for the puck in the Grimsby end last Saturday night at the South Huron Rec Centre.

Scott Nixon / Exeter Lakeshore Times-Advance 
EXETER  The Exeter Hawks quest for a Junior C championship Schmalz Cup came to a heartbreaking end last weekend with a 4-3 game six loss on home ice to the Grimsby Peach Kings in the semi-finals.The Hawks briefly led game six last Saturday night at the South Huron Rec Centre, but the Peach Kings, who will now face the Napanee Raiders in the Schmalz Cup finals, would not be denied.Grimsby got on the board first in game six, scoring the lone goal of the first period. But Exeter forward Liam Melady scored twice in about a minute in the second period to give the Hawks a short-lived 2-1 lead until Grimsby tied the game before the end of the frame.Grimsby added two more in the third before Melady completed his hat trick to narrow the score to 4-3. The Peach Kings were able to hold onto the lead and clinch their victory before a Rec Centre crowd of 1,150.Grimsby outshot Exeter 38-33 and both teams had success on the power play, with the Hawks scoring once on three opportunities and the Peach Kings going two for five. Exeter goalie Morgan Reed stopped 34 of 38 shots and was named second star of the game, behind first star Melady.After losing game one of the series, the Hawks took a 2-1 series lead, winning game two 2-1 in overtime on home ice, followed by a 4-2 victory in Grimsby. But the Peach Kings stormed back to win 4-1 in both games four and five before winning the series in Exeter in game six.Despite the loss last weekend, 2018-19 was a season to remember for the Hawks, who finished in second place in the PJHL Yeck Division in the regular season and became Yeck Division champions after winning series against the Aylmer Spitfires, the Lambeth Lancers and the Dorchester Dolphins. The Hawks then entered the Schmalz Cup and eliminated the Lakeshore Canadiens in seven games in the quarter-finals, matching them against Grimsby in the semi-finals.

Outright envy! laughs former Ponte Vedra head football coach Matt Toblin. of what Bolles was and what it represented.We had a lot of continuity. We had a coach from Notre Dame come in here a couple years ago and say you know I recruit and travel all over the country and you guys are by far the oldest staff, smiles now-former Bolles School head football coach Wayne Belger. Mikes been here forever, John Howard. We were all together and we all knew what was gonna happen in practice.But for the first time in 30-plus years, it wont be Belger or his legendary predecessor, Corky Rogers, leading practice at the Bolles School.It will be Toblin, the Mandarin native whos had a self-proclaimed massive man crush on the Bulldogs program for years.Can I promise you that Im gonna plug in and everythings gonna happen the same exact way its ever been? No, I cant promise that. But I do not want to rip apart and start from scratch when the foundation  the high-rise!  is already built, Toblin said.For as much as Bolles continues to set the standard  Toblin recalls going to watch Bolles postseason practices as a right of passage for upcoming coaches in the area  it has now been nine years since their last state championship in 2011.If nothing else, Toblin, an outsider by many accounts, brings a change of energy  as well as perspective.The longer I am here, the longer I understand this place, the more I understand  look, the gate is open for those who want to challenge themselves and put themselves in uncomfortable positions, Toblin said.Because even at the Bolles School, theres always room to grow.I hope theyre very successful. I hope it keeps on, Belger smiled. Theres another football out there [on the stadium wall] that needs to be filled with a championship on it.Tom Canavan, Ap Sports WriterCaptionCloseEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP)  The New York Giants kept two-time Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning in the dark until recently about his future with the team, and didn't give him a warning about the trade of star receiver Odell Beckham Jr. to the Cleveland Browns.Speaking as organized team activities started Monday, the 38-year-old quarterback said the Giants informed him a month ago that he would be returning for a 16th season.The stunning news of the Beckham deal came secondhand: Manning read it on a crawl across the bottom of his television screen.In other areas, Manning expects the Giants, who have won eight games over the past two seasons, to draft a quarterback. He is entering the final year of his four-year, $84 million contract.Manning is looking forward to running the offense in Pat Shurmur's second season as coach. Other players will have step up to replace Beckham, but he noted the offense ran well in the final four weeks when his top receiver was sidelined with a quad injury."I think every year I am just worried about that next year," Manning said. "That is what I am thinking about. I am thinking about right now with this team. Getting rolling, getting wins and doing whatever it takes to be a good teammate to get this team winning football games."After going 5-11 last season, the Giants offered Manning no guarantees he would be back in 2019. In his postseason talk with general manager Dave Gettleman and Shurmur, Manning told them wanted to return. They evaluated the team for roughly two months before letting him know he would have another season.The Beckham deal was less personal, coming from a TV screen. Then came the texts."That is how I found out," Manning said. "The reaction, I wanted to reach out to him. Odell has been a teammate for five years and has been a friend. These circumstances, you think about the player involved. It is more than just a player; it is someone you have a relationship with. You think more about that person, how they are handling it and that they are OK and doing well with it."The two spoke, and now they have to move on."I think after being in the NFL for 16 years, I don't think there are a whole lot of surprises anymore, "Manning said. "You learn to deal with everything. You learn to adjust, you move on and do my job. Do it to the best of my ability and get the players that are here up to speed."Sterling Shepard, who is the No. 1 receiver since the trade, had a different reaction."I was a little shocked at first, like everyone was I think, but you sit back and you look at it, it's kind of the nature of the business," said Shepard, who signed a $41 million contract extension last week. "That was a point for me to really sit back and realize that this is a business, and that's just how things go sometimes."Heading into the draft next week, the Giants have the Nos. 6 and 17 picks in the first round, the second one coming from Cleveland in the Beckham deal. New York probably needs more help on defense after losing safety Landon Collins to Washington in free agency and trading linebacker/edge rusher Olivier Vernon to the Browns.Expect a lineman to be taken with the sixth choice. With Manning's age, it's possible they could go with a quarterback at No. 17."I can see the Giants getting a young quarterback," Manning said. "I understand that. I still have to do my job. I will do my part, same as last year. Go out there, play quarterback, win football games. That is what I am trying to do."In talking to the team Monday, Shurmur did not focus on the moves the Giants made in the offseason. He is looking to move forward.NOTES: Shurmur said CB Sam Beal (shoulder) and C Jon Halapio (broken right ankle, leg) are working and getting ready for the season. ...

You may hear on the radio today the immortal words of The Beatles' 1966 hit "Taxman," which conveyed what today was all about: "Should five per cent appear too small/Be thankful I don't take it all/'Cause I'm the taxman, yeah I'm the taxman," they sang. "If you drive a car, I'll tax the street, If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat. If you get too cold I'll tax the heat, If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet. Don't ask me what I want it for, If you don't want to pay some more."
Taxes, like death, were something that would always stalk us, Benjamin Franklin reminds us  although it took the federal government 124 years before individual incomes became a regular component of the tax code. Which led us to ponder why today is the day we pay.
The dreaded 16th Amendment, which imposed income taxes, was ratified in February 1913 when Delaware became the 36th state to adopt it. Originally, according to Fortune, the idea was to set March 1 as the filing deadline. That was changed to March 15 in 1918, then moved back again in 1955, to April 15. Fortune noted the IRS explained that the extra time allowed it to spread out the workload for processing returns, which became necessary as the tax affected more middle-class families.
For what's worth, Florida is one of a handful of states that never ratified the 16th Amendment.
GARLAND: We salute Mark Brigman. Knights of Columbus St. Joseph Council 2505 in Lakeland recently presented Brigman an award for saving the life of a 6-month-old baby. According to the council, on the evening of Feb. 12 Brigman was cycling around Lake Hollingsworth near the Lakeland Yacht Club when encountered a young couple and the baby, who did not appear to be breathing. The couple seemed to be in shock. Brigman, once a Sheriffs Office Explorer, performed CPR and a few minutes later the infant spit up water and started breathing again. The couple took the child and left, without Brigman learning more about them. The council would like more information about the family. They're asking that they, or anyone who knows them, contact Council 2505 at kofclakeland.org.
GIG: We gig the Alliance of American Football, the new professional football league that recently and unexpectedly folded. It's bad enough that the league's demise left players like Gionni Paul, a former linebacker at Kathleen High School who played for the AAF team in Salt Lake City and who suffered a fractured arm in a recent game, without paychecks and on the hook for medical bills from injuries sustained while playing. Last week reports indicated that the AAF, even though it's stopped playing, was not letting its players seek opportunities in the Canadian Football League, and had balked at letting some sign NFL contracts.
GARLAND: We applaud Wenjo Lai of Lakeland Christian School, Caitlin Kaiser of Resurrection Catholic School and Grant Parker of Lakeland Highlands Middle School. They all placed second in the junior division during last month's Florida State Science and Engineering Fair, which hosted 950 participants. We also commend Allan Stewart and Connor McLoughlin, also of Lakeland Christian School, who garnered a fourth-place award and $150 each from the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Well done.
GARLAND: We cheer students at Bay High School in Panama City and city officials. Hurricane Michael destroyed their school and the country club where the students planned to hold their prom. So, city commissioners, supported by local businesses, approved a request to hold the prom in city park in downtown Panama City. Recovery is slow in the Panhandle, but kudos to these kids for not letting a lack of progress kill their spirit and desire to make things as normal as possible under tremendously difficult circumstances.
GIG/GIG: This might become a regular feature: We gig Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. Speaking in Los Angeles last month at a gathering of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which has ties to Middle Eastern terrorist groups, Omar, who has been criticized recently for repeated anti-Semitic remarks, noted in reference to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks that her hosts' parent group was founded after that horrific day in recognition "that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties." Yes, "some people"  19 to be exact  did do "something" that day: they murdered 2,977 innocent Americans. We offer another gig to Omar's better known pal: New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When Texas Republican Rep. Dan Crenshaw criticized Omar's comment as "unbelievable" on Twitter, Ocasio-Cortez tried to redirect the conversation to homegrown terrorists and shot back: "Why dont you go do something about" terrorism? Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL, lost in eye in combat in Afghanistan, the nation that provided a safe haven for the masterminds who sent "some people" to attack America. It's incomprehensible and inexcusable that sitting members of Congress, particularly one from New York City, can be dismissive of the greatest mass murder on American soil, or that Democrats running for president  such as Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Jay Inslee  can defend her remarks. Yet this is our world.

    Carson Wentz met with the media after the Eagles opened their voluntary offseason workout program Monday.
    Martin Frank, The News JournalPHILADELPHIA Carson Wentz didn't seem worried that the stress fracture in his back is still not fully healed, more than four months after the Eagles quarterback sat out the final three regular season games and two playoff games.But Wentz said Monday that he would not commit to being ready to participate when the on-field practices begin May 21. The Eagles, like most NFL teams, began their organized team activities Monday with strength and conditioning exercises that will continue over the next two weeks.All of the workouts and OTA practices are voluntary."Thats the goal, but theres really no timetable, no rush," Wentz said about the OTA practices next month. "But I feel good with the progression Ive been on."From looking at phone to criticizing booing fans, Sixers embarrass themselves in loss to NetsBut Wentz did confirm that his back isn't fully healed yet. In December, when Wentz first was sidelined, Eagles head coach Doug Pederson estimated that it could take three months to fully heal."Its still getting there," Wentz said. "Some of the stuff just takes time, but thats not the main concern. Its just kind of how I feel and were pretty good with where Im at."Right now, were kind of taking it week by week. Im throwing some, Im running some and kind of taking it week by week. Feel good."Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz (11) throws before an NFL football game against the Dallas Cowboys, in Arlington, Texas, Sunday, Dec. 9, 2018. (AP Photo/Michael Ainsworth)(Photo: Michael Ainsworth, AP)Wentz didn't want to delve into specifics about his injury or his rehab.But his back was obviously bothering him for several weeks during the season before he was shut down. This came after he spent all of last season rehabbing from a torn ACL and LCL, a process that kept him out until Week 3 last season.Eagles tight end Zach Ertz said Monday that Wentz was playing through "a broken back" for at least a few weeks. He later said that he might have "over-spoke" about that."Obviously hes been one of the most dynamic players in the league when hes healthy," Ertz said. "Was he 100 percent last year? Absolutely not. The guy had a broken back early in the year. We dont  I dont know if he knows exactly when it happened or whatnot. But hes just trying to prove to be he can be the best QB he can be for this organization."Eagles' Jalen Mills arrested after fight with Washington Wizards playerThat, Wentz said, is his goal. He said he's excited both for his future, especially in proving that he can stay healthy after suffering serious injuries in each of the last two seasons.The Eagles, of course, had Nick Foles as the backup then. Folesled the Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl victory when Wentz hurt his knee in Dec. 2017, and to four straight wins after taking over last season.Eagles-Nick Foles matchup set; team signs a quarterbackAfter the season, the Eaglesreconfirmed Wentz's status as the franchise quarterback by letting Foles leave as a free agent."Obviously, it isdifferent (without Foles)," Wentz said. "I love the heck out of him ... But thats football. Theres always turnover. And hes got an exciting opportunity ahead of him as well."Wentz is eligible for a contract extension either this offseason or next. Wentz wouldn't say if he's willing to get the extension done in the next few months, or wait until after this season."I love it here. I love this city. I love the fans here," he said. "But the specifics of all that, Im not going to dive into them. My agent will handle all of that fun stuff."If Wentz stays healthy and has an MVP caliber year as he did before his knee injury in Dec. 2017, he will be able to command a bigger contract next offseason. Wentz, for one, said he needs to prove that he can stay healthy.A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. "I want to get healthy and put everything behind me," Wentz said.Added Ertz: "I know hes extremely motivated to be the best quarterback he can be. Two years ago he was playing at an MVP level. He probably should have won the MVP that year even though he missed the last couple games. He really did build the foundation of this team."That year when we were so successful he was the reason why we got the first round bye. So Im sure his goals are to be even better than that."The Eagles did all that they could to help Wentz.Theyadded a much-needed speed receiver in DeSean Jackson and a potential lead running back in Jordan Howard. Both players were acquired in trades Jackson, the former Eagle from 2008-14, from Tampa Bay, and Howard from the Chicago Bears.On the 32-year-old Jackson, Wentz said: "Its exciting, without a doubt. You see the guy, and obviously hes getting up there in his age, but he stills run like the wind. Hes impressive on film ... The guys still got it."I think hell bring a dynamic aspect to our offense. Whether hes catching balls during the game or opening things up underneath, Im really excited to have him."But mostly, Wentz is excited to get started again. Even if he needs more time for his back to heal, the rehab process won't be nearly as intense as it was last spring with his knee.Perhaps that's why Wentz said the beginning of the offseason program Monday felt like"the first day of school."Contact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

Cest dailleurs du parvis de la cathdrale que part le kilomtre zro.Pour moi, cest peut-tre lune des cathdrales les plus quilibres, qui symbolise  la fois le travail des artistes et des hommes qui lont construite, mais elle a t,  travers les temps,  la fois trs aime et mal aime.Notre-Dame de Paris est trs aime par les Franais et les trangers qui la visitent par millions chaque anne, mais ils entrent et ressortent sans que je sois sre quils aient compris ce quest cette cathdraleEt la Renaissance et le XVIIIesicle lont pas mal mutile, par exemple, on na pas hsit  couper dans le tympan du portail central pour faire passer le dais du roi! Cest tout le travail du XIXesicle, avec Prosper Mrime, Victor Hugo, Viollet-le-Duc et Lassus, qui a permis de remettre en place lart gothique.Je pense quon na pas mis les moyens quil fallait pour lentretenir. Les travaux en cours avaient fini par tre lancs et il tait grand temps, et peut-tre mme un peu tard. Jtais monte voir au pied de la flche (avant le dbut des travaux) et il y avait des pierres disjointes, retenues par une grille pour empcher quelles tombentQue la flche soit tombe nest pas si grave, car on la reconstruira grce aux plans de Viollet-le-Duc, que je respecte beaucoup car, sans lui, la cathdrale ne serait plus l. Cest lui qui avait reconstruit la flche, car elle stait croule en 1792, sans rapport avec la Rvolution franaise.Mais on naura plus la fort, cette magnifique charpente de bois qui soutenait la toiture Et ce que je crains, cest que le feu atteigne lintrieur du chur.Le problme de Notre-Dame, cest quelle relve de plusieurs juridictions: lArchevch, la ville de Paris, les monuments historiques,etc. Ce qui rend son entretien encore plus compliqu.Jespre quil y aura une souscription nationale, voire internationale, pour financer les travaux, car a va tre trs cher.Retrouvez plus d'articles
													Dire que" la flche s'tait croule en 1792, sans rapport avec la Rvolution franaise est totalement faux", comme le souligne Le Tlgramme de ce jour : "Au cours de la Rvolution franaise, de nombreux actes de vandalisme visent la cathdrale, qui voit sa flche dmonte, son trsor pill et les grandes statues en partie dtruites. Les rvolutionnaires y ont mme organis un "Culte de la raison, le 10 novembre 1793, peu avant que le culte catholique ne soit interdit  Paris. La cathdrale seretrouve transforme en dpt". L'historienne Claude Gauvard ne semble point connatre ces faits. Ce qui, pour une historienne, est tout de mme un comble ! 
												
													Elle n'est pas la seule  dire ouvertement ce qu'il faut penser de l'investissement de l'Etat (propritaire de l'difice  priori). Le quel est mis  l'index pour de trop tardives interventions et comme la culture continue d'avoir des budgets famliques, faut pas s'tonner de grand chose. Personne ne sait ce que dira l'enqute. En esprant qu'elle sera impartiale. Mais on peut se poser des questions quand  la prvention. Les architectes disent que les travaux sont souvent la cause d'incendie. Alors pourquoi ne met-on pas en place une prvention efficace (vigie humaine, ou systmes de dtection) d'autant que tout le monde sait que le bois ( plus forte raison de cet ge) est une vritable ''allumette" ? Est-ce que les analystes "budgtaires" qui font le rapport risques/accidents survenus ne minimisent pas un peu trop vite les premiers ? Simplement pour s'viter de dpenser  tort selon eux de l'argent qui pourrait tre, toujours selon eux, mieux utilis ailleurs. 
Le petit problme c'est que, lorsque le mal est fait, il est fait. 
Mais on ne peut pas se contenter d'une seule explication selon laquelle "errare humanun est". Surtout sans voquer la seconde partie de la locution perseverare diabolicum (persver dans son erreur est diabolique).

Un an aprs avoir remport la Coupe de Bretagne, les joueurs du prsident Sgalen sont de nouveau sur le devant la scne. Et le moins que lon puisse dire, cest que les Milizacois ont t plus forts que la concurrence.Placs par les observateurs comme favoris cette saison, ils ont parfaitement assum ce rle en restant invaincus, avec la meilleure attaque et la meilleure dfense. Ils le doivent en partie  un duo dentraneur. Yohan Boulic a en effet t rejoint cette saison par Gaetan Marec. Pour Bernard Sgalen, cest aussi une victoire, mme si la saison a t assez longue. Cest vrai que cette monte est un aboutissement, mais la saison ne sera russie que si on arrive  maintenir lquipe B en R3. Avant de poursuivre: Avec le recrutement effectu, nous tions attendus, on tait lquipe  battre. Et parfois le dimanche a se sentait, mais cest comme a. Avec Philippe Masson, sur lequel je mappuie on sait que le plus dur commence maintenant, lobjectif de la saison prochaine sera bien sr de se maintenir en R1, tout en continuant  structurer le club, notamment au niveau des jeunes et des infrastructures. La mairie nous suit, nous devrions avoir dici peu un deuxime terrain synthtique, conclut le prsident milizacois.De son ct, Yohann Boulic tait galement satisfait du parcours de ses troupes. Je voudrais dabord ddier ce titre  Mederic Tansie*, jespre que de l-haut, il est fier de nous. On a un super groupe, des mecs qui avaient envie de travailler ensemble avec un super tat desprit.

What youre going to see out there this year is a team thats smart, a team thats disciplined, a team that is fundamentally sound and a team thats violent, tough and aggressive. That kind of who I am and I want our team to reflect that.Brian Flores spoke yesterday at the Dolphins coaches clinic and this quote, although weve heard it  or something similar  before, was a strong proclamation of who this football team is going to be in 2019 and beyond. The moment the team achieves this state, Flores has cleared a major hurdle in his effort to reshape the team.Why? The Dolphins were a middle of the pack team in penalties in 2018, 21st in the NFL in penalties against with 108. Thats not a bad place to be, but consider this teams recent track record.Adam Gases Dolphins were the second most penalized team in the NFL in 2017 (137 penalties). 2016? The second most penalized team in the NFL (131). 2015? The NFLs 4th most penalized team (134). By and large, this team made life more difficult for themselves, a sin that cant be consistent when you lack the talent of the teams youre trying to compete with.The focus for Brian Flores in 2019 is simple  develop your players and get them out of their own way, something not easily accomplished considering the teams recent history.Sign up for the Dolphins Wire email newsletter to get our top stories in your inbox every morning

Cest un gnie, senflamme-t-elle. Cest la seule femme qui saccompagne seule au piano dans la chanson franaise: cest une artiste trs populaire au public bien vis. Vronique Sanson est lune des idoles de la chanteuse lorientaise, qui a galement des attaches  Bannalec, o elle a dj prsent plusieurs spectacles prcdemment.Je lai toujours aime.

The Dolphins may not make much of a difference in the landscape of the 2019 NFL regular season, but theyre making all the difference in the South Florida community.Just a week after the Dolphins Cancer Challenge raised nearly $4 million on their 9th annual ride/run, the Dolphins welcomed over eight hundred youth and high school coaches to Hard Rock Stadium to help promote safe coaching habits for local players with their fourth annual coaches clinic.Miamis efforts to provide constant leadership in the local community are easy to overlook  after all, this is a football team. But the Dolphins continue to inspire on the local level, courtesy of all associated. Dolphins Youth Programs Director RaShauna Hamilton expressed her gratitude to Miami leadership.We are committed to making the game healthier and safer for South Florida student-athletes, coaches and parents, said Hamilton. It is great to have the support, time and resources of our senior leadership in Stephen Ross, Tom Garfinkel, Chris Grier and Brian Flores with important events like this that help advance our mission.Coach Brian Flores was once again on-hand, as he is seemingly every time the Dolphins host a pubic event. Flores kicked off the event yesterday by relaying how much football helped him as a youth to the coaches in attendance.I talk about this as much as I can: football, growing up a poor kid in Brooklyn, New York, I would say football is the only thing that leveled the playing field for mewhat I want to do is give you guys a round of applause for doing the things you do.The feeling should be mutual.Sign up for the Dolphins Wire email newsletter to get our top stories in your inbox every morning

Espace persoEspace persoJOURNAL DU JOURquitation. Vacances sportives en vue des concoursAsile rejet. Lex-pirate sclipseLe dploiement de la fibre optique est un enjeu majeur pour lattractivit conomique dune ville. Cela permet aux citoyens daccder  de nouveaux services. Notre ambition est claire: permettre aux habitants de profiter de la rvolution numrique, avec une qualit de services exemplaire dans tous les lieux qui comptent pour eux, souligneAlain Capp, directeur des relations avec les collectivits locales du Finistre chez Orange. Aujourdhui, 21154 foyers et entreprises de Quimper peuvent bnficier du trs haut dbit (FttH  Fiber To The Home).47% des foyers sont dj ligibles  la fibre.Dans lagglomration de Quimper Bretagne occidentale, Orange a dmarr le dploiement de la fibre optique dans quatre communes (Quimper, Pluguffan, Plomelin et Ergu-Gabric) et, dici fin 2020, le dploiement du rseau FttH stendra  onze communes, Briec, Edern, Guengat, Locronan, Plogonnec, Plonis, Qumnven, mais aussi au reste des quartiers de Quimper, Pluguffan, Plomelin et Ergu-Gabric, qui nont pas t raccords en 2019.En 2011, le gouvernement avait lanc un Appel  manifestations dintentions dinvestissement (AMII), organis dans le cadre du Programme national trs haut dbit, en vue de recueillir les choix des principaux oprateurs en matire de dploiements de rseaux de boucle locale  trs haut dbit. Orange et SFR se sont partag le gteau des villes plus densment peuples comme Brest, Lorient, Vannes ou encore Rennes et cest ainsi quest revenue  Orange la responsabilit de faire accder les Quimprois au haut dbit. Partout ailleurs, il ny aurait rien eu, affirme Mgalis Bretagne qui intervient sur 90% du territoire breton soit 60% de la population. Cette structure publique finance par la Rgion, le Dpartement et les intercommunalits permet  des villes comme Landrvarzec ou encore Langolin daccder  la fibre. Son dveloppement stablit sur trois priodes jusquen 2030. Les choix sont avant tout politiques. Sont privilgis dabord les zones artisanales et les endroits o le dbit est trs mauvais, expliqueMgalis Bretagne. Une prise optique pour un logement en zone Mgalis cote 2000. Sachant quun point de branchement peut alimenter cinq  six logements dun immeuble, cela concerne 1,2million de prises soit un cot total de 2milliards deuros.Le dploiement de la fibre comporte plusieurs phases: les tudes en coordination avec les quipes municipales, linstallation des armoires de rue permettant  lensemble des oprateurs de venir proposer leurs services, le tirage de la fibre dans les fourreaux de gnie civil existants. Afin que les habitants des quartiers concerns puissent bnficier de ce nouveau rseau, il est important quils communiquent ds aujourdhui auprs de leur syndic et de leur bailleur immobilier et demandent que le raccordement de leur immeuble soit vot en assemble gnrale, rappelleAlain Capp.Ds lors, loprateur choisi pourra installer les points de branchement en face de chaque logement et le client pourra slectionner le Fournisseur daccs internet (FAI) de son choix pour effectuer le raccordement final  son domicile.Afin de suivre les tapes du dploiement, Orange est le premier oprateur  mettre en ligne, sur le site reseaux.orange.fr, une carte de couverture compatible sur ordinateur, tablette et smartphone pour sinformer sur le dploiement de la fibre dans son quartier. Loprateur propose jusqu 1 Gigabit/s de dbit et jusqu 300 Mbit/s de dbit montant et descendant avec la nouvelle Livebox sur les offres Livebox Up et Packs Open Up.Retrouvez plus d'articlesCertains administrs ont du mal  comprendreAlain Capp, directeur des relations avec les collectivits locales du Finistre chez Orange, a prsent, ce lundi soir, et pour la premire fois  Quimper,  la mairie annexe de Kerfeunteun, lavance des travaux de la fibre optique dans la commune. Prs dune trentaine dhabitants ont rpondu  linvitation deChristian Le Bihan, adjoint au maire charg du quartier deKerfeunteun. Je suis interrog constamment, presque tous les jours, sur le dveloppement de la fibre par mes administrs. Certains ont du mal  comprendre car, dans certaines rues, des foyers sont raccords  la fibre et dautres ne le sont pas, expliqueChristian Le Bihan. Sil a dcid, avec Orange, dorganiser cette rencontre  Kerfeunteun, cest pour informer la population, qui a prouv son intrt au regard du nombre de questions prcises et documentes poses par des habitants de tous ges. Lhomme, visiblement trs port sur les nouvelles technologies, considre que son quartier est actuellement bien pourvu par le haut dbit. Si le centre-ville est un peu moins couvert par la fibre aujourdhui, cest quil se trouvait dans une situation plus favorable, trs proche des centres tlphoniques et que le dbit ADSL y tait nettement meilleur quailleurs, souligne-t-il.Ladjoint au maire assure que cette premire exprience mrite dtre renouvele. Selon les demandes, lentreprise Orange est tout  fait dispose  tenir dautres runions comme celle-ci dans dautres quartiers comme Penhars, Ergu-Armel et au centre-ville, dit-il.La fibre se dploie actuellement dans lensemble de lagglomration quimproise.

   LAF (25ejourne). Quimper pas rcompensLigue A. LeCannet - Quimper Volley 29. Quimper veut prendre des pointsVolley-ballOui, on nen est pas loin parce quen dbut de saison, on naurait jamais mis l-dessus. Au fil des mois, on y a cru de plus en plus. Et aujourdhui, on travaille dj  la saison prochaine. Maintenant que cette monte est officielle, je peux lancer de manire plus concrte le recrutement. Deux contacts sont bien avancs: lun avec un passeur, lautre avec un rceptionneur-attaquant qui tait dailleurs l dimanche au match aprs avoir pass la semaine dentranement avec nous. Il a bien apprci les gens et lesprit qui rgne ici.Il faut que lon rencontre les lus pour savoir sur quelle enveloppe on pourra sappuyer mais on sait dj que le budget dplacements reprsentera 30000. Il y a deux poules de huit quipes en lite masculine mais elles ne sont pas gographiques, elles tiennent comptent des classements des saisons prcdentes. Aprs la saison rgulire, il y a ensuite des play-offs (6 quipes) et des play-downs (10 quipes).Hsit, non. Mais les dirigeants ont pris le temps de se poser les bonnes questions. De peser le pour et le contre. Ils se sont surtout demand sil y avait une raison valable de la refuser, cette monte. Parce quil nest pas question de mettre le club en pril. Au final, on monte avec cette optique de garder notre esprit familial. Ctait le cas dimanche, avec prs de 350 personnes  nous encourager. Lquipe premire masculine doit servir lensemble du club.Cela fera partie des pourparlers avec la mairie mais il est probable que lon joue la saison prochaine  la salle Steredenn. Cest aussi, pour nous, lopportunit dvoluer. Pour attirer du monde, il va falloir activer dautres leviers. On jouera le samedi soir  20h, jespre quil y aura du public  nous suivre. On aimerait rendre cette salle vivante et agrable. Mais, dj, il faudra que sportivement, a marche!Cest faisable, oui. En tout cas, ce sera le but! Mais il y aura un cap  passer, cest clair. Si on a manqu de rgularit cette saison, cest dabord parce quon a manqu dexprience. La diffrence sera aussi physique. Pour tenter de combler notre dficit actuel, on va augmenter le volume dentranements afin daider notamment  lvolution de nos jeunes, Mal (Le Meur) et Greg (Jaworski). Pour le reste, il faudra garder nos forces: la solidarit, le travail, lengagement Si on runit tout cela, alors on se donnera des chances de maintien. Des chances intressantes!Retrouvez plus d'articles

Depuis son arrive l't dernier, on ne parle videmment que de lui... Cristiano Ronaldo avait focalis l'attention avant le quart de finale aller de Ligue des champions sur la pelouse de l'Ajax Amsterdam, lui qui s'tait bless en amont avec sa slection, et son retour avait t bienvenu puisque le quintuple Ballon d'or avait marqu aux Pays-Bas (1-1). Le Portugais sera bien l mardi soir au moment de retrouver les Lanciers lors de la manche retour, et sera videmment l'atout numro 1 de la Juventus dans l'optique de rallier le dernier carr de la comptition. Mais un autre lment important de la Vieille Dame manquera  l'appel. Il s'agit de Mario Mandzukic, l'homme  tout faire de Massimiliano Allegri, qui s'tait notamment reconverti ailier gauche au cours du prcdent exercice.Dvou au collectif, prcieux dans le domaine arien, excellent point d'appui, trs bon finisseur, loin d'tre maladroit balle au pied, combatif au possible, l'international croate est devenu le nouveau partenaire idal de "CR7", orphelin de Karim Benzema. Ce n'est sans doute pas un hasard si la Juve a offert  son numro 17 une prolongation jusqu'en 2021,  bientt 33 ans... Qu'il soit prsent ou pas, l'ancien joueur de l'Atltico de Madrid change le visage de son quipe, et la Juventus devra donc s'adapter mardi soir, contre David Neres et les siens. Reste dsormais  savoir qui sera charg de faire oublier ce grand absent, touch  un tendon d'Achille. "Il me reste  choisir qui jouera, a rpondu un Allegri vasif en confrence de presse. J'ai une ide du remplaant, mais je dciderai demain (mardi)."Trois options se prsentent  l'ancien coach de Cagliari et de l'AC Milan: Moise Kean, Paulo Dybala ou Douglas Costa. "Kean pourrait commencer, tout comme Dybala, ou les deux", a rtorqu un Allegri relanc sur le sujet. Car de l'autre ct des Alpes, la presse spcialise est persuade que c'est le jeune prodige qui sera prfr  un Argentin branch sur courant alternatif, l o le Brsilien n'est pas  100% de ses moyens physiques. Le no international italien de 18 ans a dj inscrit 6 buts en seulement 8 rencontres de Serie A cette saison, pour seulement trois titularisations. Sa forme du moment parle largement en sa faveur...Ragissez Rejoindre la discussion

Auteur d'un magnifique but lors de la victoire de Liverpool contre Chelsea dimanche en Premier League (2-0), Mohamed Salah s'est confi au micro de Sky Sports sur une saison statistique moins prolifique (19 buts et 7 passes en championnat) par rapport  l'exercice 2017-2018 (32 buts et 10 passes dcisives dans l'lite britannique).En Angleterre et surtout en Ligue des champions (3 buts en 9 matches), l'gyptien connat une priode plus irrgulire sur le plan personnel, qu'il explique par des dfenses qui s'adaptent tout simplement  son jeu: "C'est diffrent quand les autres quipes mettent deux ou trois joueurs sur moi. Man fait une trs bonne saison, de mme que Firmino, ils marquent plus de buts que la saison dernire, parce que l'attention qui est porte sur moi leur donne plus de libert, et je suis trs content pour eux. a aide l'quipe  marquer plus de buts. Quand l'adversaire se focalise sur mon ct, le ct oppos est plus libre. Nous sommes une quipe et nous nous concentrons l-dessus. Je ne me plains pas, je suis trs content du rsultat, nous sommes premiers et c'est tout ce qui compte."Malgr une baisse de rgime de leur vedette, les Reds ralisent une superbe saison avec une premire place provisoire en Premier League et une qualification en demi-finale de Ligue des champions qui se profile aprs la victoire  l'aller contre Porto (2-0).Ragissez Rejoindre la discussion

PARIJS - Een toren van de Notre-Dame is tijdens de verwoestende brand van maandagavond door het dak gestort. Dat is te zien op beelden op de Franse televisie en sociale media. Het gaat om de torenspits van het bouwwerk.Zestien grote koperen standbeelden waren toevallig vier dagen geleden uit de torenspits losgemaakt. Ze moeten worden gerestaureerd. De standbeelden zijn 3 meter hoog en wegen ongeveer 250 kilo. De beelden zijn volgens de krant Le Parisien naar Prigueux in de Dordogne gebracht en zijn dus gespaard gebleven voor de vlammen.Bekijk ook:Bekijk ook:Bekijk ook:Mot de passe oubli ?S'abonner maintenant !Acheter une archiveEn ce moment Aprs 29 ditions entre l'Europe et l'Afrique et 11 en Amrique latine, le rallye Dakar, le plus clbre des rallyes-raid, fait de nouveaux ses valises pour prendre un nouveau dpart controvers  partir de 2020 en Arabie Saoudite."Aprs trente annes  sillonner et dcouvrir l'Afrique et dix ans  s'merveiller des paysages sud-amricains, le plus grand rallye du monde va crire un nouveau chapitre au sein des dserts mystrieux et profonds du Moyen-Orient, en Arabie Saoudite", annonce l'organisateur ASO dans un communiqu lundi.L'accord court sur cinq ans et doit donner un nouvel lan  une preuve en perte de vitesse auprs des concurrents et du public, en dpit des manquements du pays en matire de droits de l'Homme ou encore de son implication dans la guerre au Ymen.Cre en 1978, la course, alors appele Paris-Dakar, tait dispute entre l'Europe et l'Afrique jusqu'en 2007, avant de dmnager en Amrique du Sud pour se prmunir de la menace terroriste.Entre 2009 et 2018, elle a fait tape en Argentine, au Chili, au Prou, en Bolivie et brivement au Paraguay. L'organiser dans cette rgion devenait toutefois de plus en plus compliqu du fait des politiques d'austrit et des contraintes mtorologiques.L'dition 2019 a ainsi t la premire  n'avoir lieu que dans un seul pays, le Prou, aprs les retraits de la Bolivie et du Chili.D'un point de vue sportif, ses quelque 2 millions de km font de l'Arabie Saoudite un excellent terrain de jeu. C'est aussi un point d'entre pour ngocier avec les pays voisins.En Amrique latine, "on connaissait le terrain par coeur", explique  l'AFP le motard franais Xavier de Soultrait. "Certains jours, on ne regardait mme pas le +road book+", le carnet de route distribu aux quipages. Dans un pays neuf, "on retrouve l'essence du rallye-raid". "C'est bien aussi pour l'quit du sport", poursuit-il. "En Amrique du Sud, les gens passaient facilement les frontires pour faire des reconnaissances, ce qui est interdit. Ce ne sera pas possible en Arabie Saoudite."A l'instar des autres pilotes professionnels, le 7e du classement moto en 2019 ne manquera pas l'vnement, sauf raison sportive. Il ne compte pas pour autant se taire sur la question des droits de l'Homme. "Y aller et aborder les sujets qui fchent, peut-tre que a peut aider", espre-t-il. "Pour moi, c'est mme un devoir d'essayer d'avoir un petit mot."De Soultrait estime par contre que des amateurs et leurs sponsors pourraient "boycotter" cette destination controverse.

The late Maryland House Speaker Michael Busch arrived at the State House Monday for the last time. Busch died on April 7 at the age of 72.A Maryland State Police honor guard escorted Busch to the State House, where the procession was greeted by a crowd of family, friends, staff and current and former elected officials from all levels of government.Gov. Larry Hogan opened the ceremony, which also featured remarks by Sen. Ben Cardin, former Sen. Barbara Mikulski, and state delegates Maggie McIntosh, Dereck Davis and Adrienne Jones.Mike Busch dedicated the greater part of his life in service to our state, and he left Maryland a better place than when he found it, Hogan said.Busch was first elected to the House of Delegates in 1986. He became speaker in 2003 and was the longest-serving speaker in state history.Busch will lie in repose under the State House dome, where the public may pay their respects Monday until 7 p.m. and Tuesday morning between 8 and 10. His funeral will be Tuesday at St. John Neumann Church on Bestgate Road in Annapolis. The General Assembly wrapped up its 439th session Monday night in Annapolis, and for the first time since 2003, Michael Busch wasnt overseeing the House of Delegates as speaker. Busch died Sunday at the age of 72 after he was hospitalized with pneumonia.The frenzied, celebratory atmosphere thats typical on the last day of the General Assemblys 90-day session was marred by Buschs absence. The death Sunday of Michael Busch, Maryland's longest serving Speaker of the House of Delegates, has cast a pall over Marylands General Assembly as it rushes toward its adjournment at midnight Monday.Reports of his death at the age of 72 brought a flood of fond memories from his friends and colleagues in the State House as well as others who have known the former high school teacher and football coach for years.Statements of grief and sympathy at the death of House Speaker Michael Busch came quickly from both sides of the political aisle and all around the state."My heart is broken for Mike Buschs family, the State of Maryland, and the Speaker'sextended family - elected officials and staff that he has been a mentor and coach to over his time in public service," Senate President Mike Miller wrote in a statement.The funeral for Michael Busch, the longest serving speaker of Marylands House of Delegates, has been scheduled at 11 a.m. Tuesday, April 16, at St. John Neumann Catholic Church on Bestgate Road in Annapolis, a spokesman for the family has announced.Busch, who was 72, died Sunday after having undergone treatments for pneumonia.His death cast a pall over the usually frantic, celebratory last day of the General Assembly session. In an unusual move, both Houses stopped work at 11:30 Monday evening, a half hour early, for a joint session to honor the late speaker.

Les rencontres entre Madagascar, la Guine et le Nigeria sont sous le signe des retrouvailles.Les protgs de Nicolas Dupuis dbutent leur campagne  la CAN en Egypte contre la Sili National de Guine le 22 juin. C'est une retrouvaille entre les deux formations, mais cette fois-ci en match de poules de la phase finale de la CAN, si en 2011, les deux slections se sont affrontes dans le cadre des liminatoires de la CAN 2013. Les Malgaches classs 107e sont  leur premire participation  la CAN, si leurs adversaires, classs 68e mondial gotent leur 12e CAN en Egypte du 21 juin au 19 juillet. La rencontre entre Burundi et Madagascar le 27 juin, c'est--dire le lendemain de la fte nationale est le duel de  petits poucets . Madagascar tout comme le Burundi vient pour la premire fois  la CAN. La bande  Faneva Ima ne connait pas trop cette slection burundaise qui s'est permis de luxe d'liminer le Gabon de Pierre Aubameyang. La dernire rencontre des Barea se jouera contre les Super Eagles de Nigeria.Les Nigrians sont les favoris du groupe B, ayant disput la dernire Coupe du monde en Russie en 2018.  Je ne crois pas que le fait de jouer contre deux novices soit un avantage. Les pays qui, comme Madagascar ou le Burundi, viennent pour la premire fois, jouent en gnral avec beaucoup d'enthousiasme. Ils viennent aussi avec beaucoup de supporters. J'ai beaucoup de respect pour Madagascar. C'est un pays que j'adore. Il y a beaucoup de bons footballeurs l-bas. Il y a aussi le Burundi qui a sorti le Gabon en liminatoires. Il ne faudra pas sous-estimer les Burundais. En tout cas, on les prendra trs au srieux  a expliqu Gernot Rohr, entraneur du Nigeria aprs le tirage au sort. Mais  deux mois de cette joute continentale, deux joueurs malgaches sont blesss  savoir Lalaina Nomenjanahary touch  la cheville et Zotsara Randriambololona au genou droit. Comme les Barea sont maintenant fixs sur leurs adversaires, les frus du ballon rond et les joueurs attendent une prparation digne d'une quipe qualifie  la CAN.

Reigning champions FFC Frankfurt begin their title defence with a trip to Belgium in October, with today's Women's Champions League draw pitting them against Standard Lige in a fairly straight forward tie to start their 2015-16 campaign.However, the pick of the round is certainly an all-British affair between Chelsea and Glasgow City, whilst the new Frauen-Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich, face a tough task in a young, promising FC Twente side.The favourites for the competition will undoubtedly be the three German outfits, Frankfurt, VfL Wolfsburg and Bayern, and the two French teams, Olympique Lyonnais and Paris Saint-Germain, whilst FC Rosengrd of Sweden are certainly a good shout for an underdog with their star-studded squad.Most will be happy with their draws too in the first round - the women's edition of the competition going straight into a knockout round as opposed to group stages as the men's does. Frankfurt, as aforementioned, play Lige, Wolfsburg face Serbia's Spartak Subotica, who topped their qualifying round group, but Bayern may have problems with Twente, who boast a number of Dutch internationals, including the likes of Anouk Dekker, Stefanie van der Gragt and Siri Worm.As for the French sides, Lyon face Medyk Konin, who could have been a danger but for Ewa Pajor's transfer to Wolfsburg this summer, the Polish side having almost made it to the last 16 last year only for Glasgow to overcome a 2-0 deficit in the second leg, whilst PSG play another qualifier in Romanian side Olimpia Cluj.Rosengrd have another straight-forward match as they play Finland's PK-35 Vantaa, and will be happy with the short journey to face a fellow Scandinavian outfit too, as well as being confident in beating the qualifier whilst they are there.For those who came through the qualifying round to reach the knockout stage, the draw has been rather harsh. The chances of having a survivor from that round in the next round look slim, which is a shame after Glasgow represented the qualifiers so marvellously last year, reaching the quarter-finals, only to be defeated by eventual finalists PSG, in a run which meant they earned Scotland a berth in the knockout round automatically for this season.With Cluj, Twente, Vantaa, Subotica and Konin all having to face one of the favourites for the title, things don't look good, and the remaining three qualifiers didn't get much better fixtures either.Greek outfit PAOK will face Swedish side KIF rebro, runners-up in their domestic league, the Damallsvenskan, last season, Icelandic representatives Stjarnan play Russia's Zvezda Perm, a repeat of last year's round of 32 tie that saw the latter win 8-3 over two legs, whilst ZFK Minsk of Belarus play Denmark's Fortuna Hjrring, who were only eliminated in the last 16 in 2014-15 by Rosengrd.Stjarnan perhaps harbour the best chance of progressing, but, especially after last year's result, overcoming Zvezda will be a big ask.Whilst the men's Champions League final this year was a case of Spain v Italy, in Barcelona v Juventus, the chances of the women's side producing a similar final in 2015-16 are slim, with neither country excelling on the continent in the women's game.Barcelona's female section, however, will be expected to do well, especially after a disappointing campaign last time out. Bristol Academy, now struggling at the bottom of the FA WSL 1 in England, overcame the Spaniards in the round of 16 last year, beating them 1-0 on the road, ending their 55 game unbeaten run at home in the process, before a 1-1 draw sealed the Vixens place in the last eight.However, Barca this time face BIIK Kazygurt in a more obscure tie that requires them to make the trip to Kazakhstan. Kazygurt cannot be underestimated either, as they did manage to clinch a 2-2 draw at home to Frankfurt in this round last year. Even though the Germans turned things around in their home leg, this was the only game they lost in the 2014-15 campaign that saw them end as champions.Spain have two representatives in the competition for the first time this year as well, with Atletico Madrid being the other. The debutants, one of three along with rebro and Chelsea, face ZorkyKrasnogorsk in a tricky first fixture against the 2012-13 champions of Russia.On the Italian side of things, they too have two clubs in the knockout round - ASD Verona and Brescia, the former seeded and the latter not. Thus, it is Verona with the more favourable draw, facing Austrian side FSK St. Plten-Spratzern in the first round.Brescia, on the other hand, will play reigning WSL 1 champions Liverpool. The English side were unable to make it to the round of 16 last year, given a tough draw against Linkping which they narrowly lost, but will be confident of bettering that this season against their Italian opponents.With Rosengard, Hjrring and rebro all having favourable draws, the latter albeit at the expense of Finland's Vantaa, many will back Scandinavia to have a good 2015-16 campaign in the competition too, something which is backed up by Danish side Brndby's draw against SK Slavia Praha of the Czech Republic.However, LSK Kvinner FK of Norway do not have the greatest draw, one of just two unseeded sides from the area of Europe. LSK will face FC Zrich of Switzerland in the round of 32, and will find it difficult to overcome an all Swiss squad that boasts the likes of internationals Fabienne Humm and Nicole Remund.Yet, despite all the intriguing ties above, it is Chelsea's draw against Glasgow that is the most interesting, with the current WSL 1 leads facing the Scottish champions.Glasgow have dominated women's football in their country over the last few years, and had a tremendous run to the quarter-finals in this competition last year, whereas Chelsea only won their first trophy, the FA Women's Cup, this summer.Still, with the likes of Ji So-yun and Eniola Aluko in their squad, the Blues will be no pushover and will arguably go into the game as favourites with the competitiveness of England readying them more.The two did meet earlier this year in a pre-season friendly, with the English outfit winning 2-0 in February, but Glasgow's home crowd played a crucial role in their great Champions League showing last season, inspiring them to overcome two first leg deficits, and so the trip to Scotland will be difficult for Chelsea.BIIK Kazygurt v BarcelonaMedyk Konin v LyonOlimpia Cluj v PSGSlavia Praha v BrndbyStandard Lige v FFC FrankfurtPAOK v KIF rebroFC Twente vBayern MunichAtltico Madrid v ZorkiySt. Plten-Spratzern v VeronaStjarnan v Zvezda PermLSK Kvinner vFC ZrichChelsea v Glasgow CityPK-35 Vantaa v RosengrdZFK Minsk v Fortuna HjrringSpartak Subotica v WolfsburgBrescia v Liverpool

Si le Bayern Munich se serait positionn ds cet hiver, le Dogue serait galement dans le viseur du PSG. Une ventualit que ncarte pas le patron du club nordiste."Il ny a quune seule quipe en Ligue 1 qui peut garder (en France) un joueur comme Pp. Mais jai vraiment ferm la porte  toutes les discussions dici  la premire ou deuxime semaine de mai, a-t-il dclar. Sil y avait une chance quil reste en Ligue 1,a passerait effectivement par le PSG. Mais il ny a pas de contact. Je ne sais pas sils sont intresss ou pas, et nous, on na pas cherch  en avoir."La situation devrait donc voluer rapidement et, selon RMC Sport, les Parisiens la suivraient avec beaucoup d'attention. On imagine que Thomas Tuchel, qui se plaint du manque de profondeur de son effectif, ne serait pas contre sa venue. Avant daffronter le Losc (5-1), il avait dailleurs dit tout le bien quil pensait de Nicolas Pp, "un joueur qui a beaucoup de qualit" et "peut faire de grandes choses".Ragissez Rejoindre la discussion

  Tobias Haupt ist ein Fuballverrckter.Er analysiertSysteme, studiertSpiele und denkt den ganzenTag darber nach.Mit diesem Enthusiasmus soll er auch die Ausbildung des DFBvoranbringen.
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Als Aktiver war Tobias Haupt kein Vorreiter des fortschrittlichen Fuballs. "Ich war ein Alte-Schule-Torwart, da hat man das Tor noch verteidigt. Der moderne Torhter hat sich erst nach mir entwickelt", sagt der Fuballverrckte mit einem breiten Grinsen.Doch so wenig der 35-Jhrige das Spiel auf dem Rasen revolutioniert hat, so sehr soll er als Akademie-Leiter des Deutschen Fuball-Bundes (DFB) knftigAus- und Weiterbildung vorantreiben. Und zu einer Art Kompass und Lexikon in demFuballland werden, das neue Entwicklungen in den vergangenen Jahren und Monaten gerne mal zu verschlafen drohte.Knapp zehn Monate nach dem blamablenVorrunden-Aus der Nationalmannschaft bei derWeltmeisterschaft in Russland steht in dieser Woche auch kein deutscher Club im Viertelfinale der Champions League. Frankreichs Nationalteam berragt, dazu prgen die englischen und spanischen Top-Vereine die europischenWettbewerbe. Doch mit dem 150 MillionenEuro teuren Neubau der Akademie in Frankfurt amMain und einer inhaltlichen Neuausrichtung soll alles besser werden. "Es ist eine gewisse Aufbruchstimmung zu erkennen.Die Trainer und viele weitere Experten aus der Praxis haben Lust, da mitzuwirken", sagt Haupt. Der Spatenstich fr den Bau erfolgt am 3. Mai.Der35-Jhrige aus Niederbayern hat sich akribisch in die Ablufe des Millionengeschfts eingearbeitet.Haupt hat Sport-Management studiert, arbeitete bei Hannover 96, schrieb seine Doktorarbeit dort im Verein und baute danach das Internationale Fuball-Institut in Ismaning ber Jahre mit auf.Nun will er mit ganz viel Input vonTrainern,Spielern und Vereinen beim DFB neue Strukturen schaffen - und denVerband moderner werden lassen.Als Oliver Bierhoff bei ihm anrief, war er sofort begeistert.Der Posten des Akademie-Leiters beimDFB sei einer von nur drei Jobs, fr die er bereit gewesen sei, seine frhereTtigkeit und das Umfeld imRaum Mnchen aufzugeben. Was die anderen beiden Jobs gewesen wren, verrt Haupt nicht."Wir lagen ab der ersten Sekunde auf einer Wellenlnge. Es ist eine Riesenherausforderung und eine hochspannende Aufgabe" sagt Haupt, der inhaltlich unter anderem die Trainerausbildung an die modernen Bedrfnisse angleicht, eine Mentorenausbildung fr jungeSpieler vorantreibt und versucht, mehr Fachwissen von erfolgreichen Ex-Profis in den Verband zu holen. Als der frhereDFB-KapitnMichaelBallack jngst harsche Kritik am Verband bte, antwortete Haupt sachlich und lsungsorientiert: "Fr Anregungen von Ex-Nationalspielern sind wir immer offen. Er kann sich mit Verbesserungsvorschlgen jederzeit an uns wenden und wird Gehr finden", sagte er im Interview mit "Stuttgarter Zeitung" und "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".DFB-Direktor Bierhoff ist von Haupt begeistert und geht fest davon aus, dass der ehrgeizige und umtriebige "Professor" den deutschenFuball mit seinen Ideen und seiner Akribie wieder nher an die Spitze bringen wird. "Er wird uns helfen, das viele bereits vorhandene Wissen im DFB noch effektiver in die Ausbildung einzubringen und innovativeWege zu gehen", sagt Bierhoff.Dafr nimmtder Wahl-Frankfurter Haupt auch einenkleinenKulturwechsel in Kauf, der ihm gar nicht schwer gefallen ist:"Ich habe die Hessen sehr tolerant erlebt, dass sie einen Migranten aus Bayern so herzlich aufnehmen."

Bleiben Sie mit unserem Newsletter immer kostenlos gut informiert!Mit dem Abschicken Ihrer E-Mail akzeptieren Sie unsere Nutzungsbedingungen Barry Wilner, Ap Pro Football WriterCaptionCloseNEW YORK (AP)  Just as he had the true touch when he threw passes, set records and won two Super Bowls, Peyton Manning has the right approach when looking at some of the NFL's greatest moments.ESPN, NFL Films and the league itself clearly felt that way.Manning, a lock for the Pro Football Hall of Fame when he becomes eligible in 2021, is hosting and serving as an executive producer for "Peyton's Places," a five-part, 30-episode series celebrating the NFL's 100th season. The show debuts on ESPN+ in July, with ESPN and ABC airing special compilations.For the quarterback, it was a labor of love, a journey into pro football's past that was educational, humorous and heartfelt."NFL Films has been great throughout this and they approached me about doing it to tell the story of the past 100 years," Manning says. "They certainly had a template and blueprint they wanted to tell, and we had certain people we wanted to talk to and visit and have conversations about how football got started."So Manning dived all the way back to Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom in Canton, Ohio. He spent time with members of the undefeated 1972 Dolphins; rewatched Super Bowl 3 with Joe Namath; discussed the Immaculate Reception with Steelers and Raiders to get the Pittsburgh and Oakland viewpoints; and discovered intriguing connections to the NFL for Richard Nixon, Jay Leno and Elvis."We got to go down memory lane," Manning says. "I have always loved the history of the game and I have learned a lot during this journey, and spent some time with some of my favorite players and contemporaries of my dad (former Saints star quarterback Archie Manning) and guys he looked up to."NFL Films has all this great archives of (Bears founder) George Halas talking about being in Ralph Hay's Hupmobile showroom, (Giants owner) Wellington Mara talking about how Vince Lombardi wanted him to take Polaroids and throw them down to the field when Vince was coaching with the Giants. To maybe re-enact it or kind of tell that story, it's kind of why I signed up for it."Along the way, Manning channeled his inner comedian, as displayed in TV commercials and as host of "Saturday Night Live."A big fan of Elvis Presley, Manning visited Graceland and "may or may not" have dressed up in an Elvis costume. He did discover that Presley staged impromptu games at local parks and was such a die-hard NFL fan he had three television sets on hand so he could watch as much football as possible."He got the idea from Lyndon Baines Johnson, who had three TVs so he could watch the news and political news coverage," Manning explains.Manning and Cris Carter also tried to replicate a stunt the New York Giants performed at the O'Keeffe Radiator Building in Manhattan  now the American Radiator Building. In 1926, the Giants' Lynn Bomar threw a ball to the ground from 324 feet up on the 23-story building, and Hinkey Haines caught it."Back in the '20s, the forward pass was like a circus act," Manning says. "When you were in the red zone and threw a pass into the end zone and it was incomplete, the other team got the ball; that was news to me. Clearly, teams didn't want to throw it."But to get some buzz and interest with the team not drawing well, the Giants did this publicity stunt and had (Bomar) throw a pass off the building. So I threw a pass down to Cris Carter at the same spot and he caught it. It was pretty neat."Also neat, no doubt, was having Manning service motorist's cars at the Vince Lombardi Travel Plaza on the New Jersey Turnpike. Manning dressed up as an attendant and "would give them a lecture or seminar on Vince Lombardi" while they were gassing up. The customers were given $10 off their bill if they could correctly answer questions about Lombardi.Paying homage to one of the NFL's great QBs, Sammy Baugh, who also played safety and was an All-Pro punter, Manning had Deion Sanders "try to teach me" to play defensive back. "That provided some challenges," Manning says with a chuckle.He visited with Jay Leno, a renowned classic car collector, to discuss the Hupmobile, an auto on which several future NFL franchise owners sat (on the running boards) "drinking prohibition beer" as the league was formed."I hope people who love football will find it entertaining," he says. "I certainly have not been afraid to make fun of myself."The fun of the series is accompanied by a reverence for the history of his sport. Such highlights as sitting with Roger Staubach and watching the long pass to Drew Pearson that spawned the "Hail Mary" description of such plays. Or chatting with Jim Brown about his career  in football and lacrosse and acting. Or researching the role of Bert Bell, the league's second commissioner who created the draft, scheduled games for Sundays  college football, more popular in the those days, owned Saturdays  and insisted on blackouts when television became a factor."Bert Bell made a bad investment, putting his money in a pro football team, guys in leather helmets running into each other," Manning says with a sarcastic laugh. "Bert Bell was a pioneer."Bell and Nixon likely wouldn't have gotten along. Nixon, as Manning discovered, was so annoyed he couldn't watch the Redskins' home games from the White House during his 1969-74 administration that he asked NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to lift the blackouts."Rozelle refused, saying it would hurt attendance," Manning says. "So, basically, Nixon got Congress to pass a law to end the blackouts. He called it one of the greatest achievements of his administration, and that shows you how important it was to people who wanted to watch their teams. And still is."___More AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFLPIGEON FORGE, Tenn.

  Hertha-Urgestein Pal Dardai droht das Aus. Die Berliner sollen in der aktuellenKrise bereits auf der Suche nach einem Coach fr die kommende Saison sein. Der Trainer gibt sich aber kmpferisch.
Berlin (dpa) - Pal Dardai spielte mit der silbernen Trillerpfeife in seiner rechten Hand, drckte den Rcken durch und hielt ein vehementes Pldoyer in eigener Sache.Trotz der schwrzesten Serie in seiner Zeit als Chefcoach von Hertha BSC und der drohenden Ablsung gibt sich der 43 Jahre alte Ungar demonstrativ kmpferisch und will nichts von einem Vertrauensverlust im Club wissen. "Ich habe vom Manager noch nichts gehrt, dass er unzufrieden mit mir ist", sagte Dardai am Montagmorgen am Rand des Trainingsplatzes. "Wenn das so ist, kann er es ruhig sagen  und auch alle anderen. Ich komme mit der richtigen Kritik sehr gut klar."ffentlich geuerte Tadel fr die Arbeit des Hertha-Urgesteins gibt es zum Start in die Trainingswoche vor dem Schlsselspiel gegen Hannover 96 am Ostersonntag weiter nicht. Doch die Unzufriedenheit mit dem erneuten Absturz in der Rckrunde ist offenkundig, dies sei nicht "hinzunehmen", betonte Geschftsfhrer Michael Preetz zuletzt. Berichten der "Bild" und des "Kicker" zufolge sollen die Berliner schon vor der fnften Niederlage nacheinander mit der Suche nach einem neuen Coach fr die kommende Spielzeit begonnen haben."Ich mache meinen Job mit Spa. Ich habe jeden Tag Spa, solange ich das Vertrauen der Spieler, des Managers und des Prsidenten habe", beteuerte Hertha-Rekordspieler Dardai am Tag nach dem 0:2 bei 1899 Hoffenheim. "Und wenn das Vertrauen nicht da ist, dann will man das hren, dann muss man sich zusammensetzen und reden. Ich geniee hier momentan noch Vertrauen."Nach einer soliden Vorrunde ist aber selbst das defensiv formulierte Saisonziel eines einstelligen Tabellenplatzes mit inzwischen zehn Punkten Rckstand auf Rang neun auer Reichweite. Auch in der vierten kompletten Saison unter Dardai geht die Leistungskurve nach der Winterpause steil bergab - die personelle Situation mit Ausfllen mehrerer Leistungstrger war dabei zuletzt allerdings prekr.Zu Beginn der Saison hatte Dardai noch mit Erfolg ein neues taktisches System installiert, mit starken Auftritten gegen Borussia Mnchengladbach, den FCBayern und Borussia Dortmund Achtungserfolge gefeiert. Doch besonders gegen vermeintlich schwchere Gegner taten sich die Berliner schwer, die Laufleistung ist nur noch beim FCSchalke 04 schlechter, auch bei den Sprints gehrt Hertha zu den schwcheren Teams. Es gebe seit viereinhalb Jahren "Top-Training", verteidigte sich Dardai gegen Kritik an angeblich eintnigen bungseinheiten.Nun stnde dennoch eine ra vor dem Ende: Nur Helmut Kronsbein und Jrgen Rber waren bei Hertha lnger als Chefcoach ttig, in der Bundesliga ist Dardai nach Christian Streich vom SC Freiburg der aktuell dienstlteste Coach.Erst Ende Januar hatte Manager Preetz besttigt, dass sich der Verein mit Dardai ber ein weiteres Jahr als Chefcoach der Profis und einen "gemeinsamen Weg" geeinigt habe. Sollte es zur Trennung kommen, wre das aber nicht automatisch das Ende von Dardai bei Hertha:Der Rekordspieler des Clubs ist mit einem unbefristeten Kontrakt ausgestattet, um nach einem Aus als Proficoach wieder in den Jugendbereich zurckkehren zu knnen.

(AP)  Democratic Secretary of State Steve Simon says he expects to ask the Minnesota Supreme Court to review a ruling that voter data sought by a conservative election watchdog group is public.A Ramsey County judge sided with the Minnesota Voters Alliance last July, and the Court of Appeals upheld that decision Monday.The group sued to obtain data on millions of voters that Simon's office contends should be kept private. The data pertain to a voter's status including whether they've been challenged, the reason for that challenge and their voting history.The courts say the data is public under Minnesota's open records law. Much of the other data in the Statewide Voter Registration System is already public.The alliance says it wants to see if the data shows voter fraud.To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.AboutContactBayern Munich confirmedFranck Ribery and Corentin Tolisso both trained with the squad on Monday, handing Niko Kovac a boost for the Bundesliga title race.Tolisso has been out of action since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury last September, with his comeback temporarily halted by a minor setback suffered in training.However, the France midfielder was able to take part ina session that was staged in front of 1,500 Bayern supporters.Ribery, who missed the away win atFortuna Dusseldorf with a cold, was also able to train, while Rafinha and Arjen Robben worked individually.Bayern said Robben "completed an intense session comprising sprints, changes of direction, passes and shots on an adjacent pitch". However, they refused to say when the 35-year-old can resume duties with the rest of the squad.Manuel Neuer and Mats Hummels, however, were both absent from training after they sustained injuries at the weekend.Bayern, a point clear of Borussia Dortmund at the top of the table, are back in action at home toWerder Bremen on Saturday.




Now that spring football practice has come to an end, the Trojans wont take the field again to prepare for the 2019 season for two months. Theres no shortage of questions surrounding the team; the way it bounces back from last years disappointing season may define the program for years to come. Though little more than a month of spring football doesnt make the answers to those questions much clearer, it does give a better idea of what to expect from some of the younger team members. Throughout spring ball, a number of early-enrollee incoming freshmen on both sides of the ball made strong cases for playing time in the fall. With the loss of so many veterans to the draft, the freshmens ability to step up and contribute will be perhaps the most critical factor in the coming season. Defensive back Briton Allen, a late flip from Georgia Tech, found his way into plenty of reps this spring as a result of the numerous injuries hampering the secondary. Allen performed impressively when thrust into the fire at cornerback in the early practices  a departure from his usual safety position. Though his technique and footwork in coverage have a ways to go, Allens raw football instincts and aggressiveness showed up regularly. Allen continued to play well once he was moved back to safety, a position where the Trojans sorely lack depth. With the loss of so many veteran players in the secondary and the injury woes of many that remain, Allens versatility could make him a crucial player in the fall.Outside linebacker and defensive end Drake Jackson was perhaps the biggest shining star of spring ball. Jackson already looks the part of a Division I edge rusher, standing at 6-foot-4 and 260 pounds and having been compared to USC legend Leonard Williams by head coach Clay Helton. Jackson carries that frame with tremendous athleticism, showing a rare burst off the line of scrimmage along with a special quickness in moving off of blocks. Jackson showcased his raw physical ability during the spring showcase, where he made a ridiculous one-handed interception at the line of scrimmage and proceeded to run it back for a touchdown. Jackson has been one of the most disruptive players on the Trojan front seven throughout the spring, and seems likely to have a big role to play come fall.On the other side of the ball, quarterback Kedon Slovis has been a pleasant surprise for the Trojans. The Arizona native came into the spring with few expectations other than to be the fourth-string quarterback, yet his strong play has caught the attention of everyone in attendance. Slovis showcases a natural understanding of the timing necessary for throws in offensive coordinator Graham Harrells system, as well as refined touch on his passes. He doesnt have the strongest arm, and his mobility is limited. However, his ability to quickly make reads and put the ball where and when it needs to be makes him worthy of notice at the position. Although its highly unlikely he wins the starting job, his ability to run the offense smoothly provides the Trojans with more security at signal caller  something a team always needs.Fellow offensive newcomer wide receiver John Jackson III has been one of the most fun players to watch throughout the spring. From the first week of practice, Jackson has looked like hes played in this offense for years. His route running is smooth and sudden, with exceptionally clean breaks that allow him to create separation with ease. His natural athleticism, sound hands and route-running ability made him a favorite target throughout spring ball, regularly making plays against the first team defense. Though the receiver room is crowded with an incredible amount of talent, Jacksons performance so far should earn him the opportunity to fight for a bigger role in fall camp. It wouldnt be a surprise to see him on the field regularly once the season begins.TURN, Italia (AP)  La polica italiana detuvo a 54 hinchas armados del Ajax el lunes, en la vspera del partido de la Liga de Campeones que ese equipo disputar contra la Juventus.Los seguidores del club holands fueron interceptados a bordo de autobuses en las afueras de Turn, y las autoridades los escoltarn para que abandonen el territorio italiano el martes.Las autoridades se encuentran en alerta tras los enfrentamientos registrados entre seguidores del Ajax y de la Juve la semana pasada, en la antesala del partido de ida de los cuartos de final en msterdam.

"After tonight's training, we will see."The fact that he is not training yet is not decisive in terms of whether he will play. We don't test it that way."We live hour by hour, day by day. We are willing to take a responsible risk."Frenkie has to listen carefully to his body and ultimately I make the decision. We are in a positive way."The tie is finely poised at 1-1 after David Neres struck to cancel out Cristiano Ronaldo's headed opener in the first leg.In the last round, Ajax lost 2-1 at home to Real Madrid before stunning the three-time defending champions at the Santiago Bernabeu with a 4-1 victory."Juve are the favourites, especially after the Amsterdam result," Ten Hag said. "If we play well, we can overcome any limit."[Massimiliano] Allegri is very knowledgeable and has certainly thought of a different way to approach this game compared to last week. We need to improve our tactical plan."Nicolas Tagliafico misses out through suspension, but Ten Hag was unwilling to give Allegri any clues as to who could replace the left-back, or which player could be tasked with marking Ronaldo."[Noussair] Mazraoui can play there, but so can [Daley] Sinkgraven," Ten Hag added. "We can also move [Daley] Blind. We are not going to put a permanent man on Ronaldo  we will never do that."NEW YORK (AP)  A team of three Associated Press journalists won a Pulitzer Prize in international reporting Monday for their work documenting torture, graft and starvation in Yemen's brutal civil war.Reporter Maggie Michael, photographer Nariman El-Mofty and video journalist Maad al-Zikry spent a year uncovering atrocities and suffering in Yemen, shining a light on a conflict largely ignored by the American public.In a series of stories, they told of how famished people in parts of Yemen were reduced to eating leaves to stay alive while corrupt officials diverted international food aid.Their reports documented civilian casualties of a U.S. drone campaign, drew attention to the presence of child soldiers on the front lines and showed evidence of torture by both Houthi rebels and U.S.-backed forces . For one report, Michael managed to interview seven torture victims while they were still being held prisoner.Their images and stories, gathered at times under dangerous conditions, made a difference.At least 80 prisoners were released from secret detention sites controlled by the United Arab Emirates after one of their reports. A Houthi leader ordered an investigation of rebel-run prisons, saying that torture was "unforgivable."The United Nations rushed food and medicine to areas where the AP revealed that people were starving and threatened to cut off aid to Houthi-controlled areas unless corrupt food diversions stopped."AP's groundbreaking work in Yemen has drawn the world's attention to one of the worst tragedies of our time," said AP's executive editor, Sally Buzbee. "Yemen is one of the most dangerous places in the world to report. And yet, again and again, this team braved those dangers to tell stories that the world heard from no other source, and with extraordinary detail."To do their work, the three journalists had to travel through dangerous areas, avoid groups angered by their reporting and work to protect the people who spoke with them from danger. The AP pulled Al-Zikry from Yemen in late 2018 because it was concerned about his safety, a step it had also taken in 2017.The AP's investigative reporting on the war in Yemen in 2018 was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.The staff of Reuters was also awarded a Pulitzer in international reporting for an investigation of a massacre of Rohingya men and boys in a village in Myanmar. The award included a special acknowledgement for journalists Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, who were arrested in December 2017 by the Myanmar government during the course of their reporting and sentenced to seven years in prison.The prizes were announced in New York at Columbia University.Michael, an Egyptian based in Cairo, joined the AP in 2002. She has covered political and religious conflict in the Middle East and, as part of AP's investigations team, has written about civilian casualties in Iraq.Nariman Ayman El-Mofty is a Canadian-Egyptian photographer. She worked first as a photo editor, then since 2016 as a photographer covering Egypt, Yemen and other parts of the Mideast.Al-Zikry is a Yemeni video journalist who has spent years chronicling the war and its horrors. His photograph of an emaciated infant dying at a hospital in 2016 helped bring world attention to starvation in Yemen.They worked closely with editor Lee Keath, based in Cairo, who has covered the Middle East for the AP since 2005."This is a story that everybody was not really paying good attention, and we're very happy to be able to draw some attention to it," Michael said.The Pulitzer covers the AP's work on Yemen in 2018, but the team has continued its reporting. Earlier this month, Michael revealed that Yemen's cholera epidemic has been worsened by corruption.This is the AP's 53rd Pulitzer overall. The last came in 2016, when the news organization won a Pulitzer for public service for an investigation of enslaved fishermen in Southeast Asia.AP journalists were finalists for five Pulitzers in all this year, including the work on Yemen, the most since the Pulitzer board began revealing the names of finalists as well as winners in 1980.AP photographers Noah Berger, John Locher and Ringo H.W. Chiu were finalists in the breaking news category for coverage of wildfires in California.

It wasn't long ago."Taking chances is key and the best strikers are the most expensive. We've practiced finishing as not working the goalkeeper means you can't score. We need to be focused as we know we're going to create chances. We need to take a deep breath and make sure we take them."It's massive, belief is massive. Everyone has talent and certain ability to play at this level but we've seen ourselves against PSG we can come back against a fantastic team."Historically, Barca are the best in the last 10 years so we know it's a massive effort, but they've done it before and if we give our all and have better concentration."We slept for one second, they had the ball a lot, but that's what they did and when we switched off with [Sergio] Busquets in five yards of space he played it toMessi. Belief is one thing but concentration is another."Solskjaer, of course, can draw on his own experience of a Champions League comeback at Camp Nou, having scored the dramatic late winner for United against Bayern in the 1999 final."Many emotions. It's a fantastic memory for me," the Norwegian said when asked about that game."The last time, it was the only time I've played here."I brought my son to El Clasico in 2016 and 10 days ago I came to watch [Barcelona play]Atletico Madrid.But I don't look back on that night [in 1999]. I'm just focused and looking forward to tomorrow, we need to play better and that's my job now."In football anything can happen. We can still be in the tie in the 90th minute ifwe get a clean sheet. We're physically taller and bigger but it's about quality. We need to defend well but going forward we need to score. I don't mind if it's in the 93rd minute as we're a fit team and we're getting fitter and fitter."I believe you get what you deserve, that if you put your life and everything you have in you get what you deserve. But sometimes people say it has to be our year -20 years ago, I wore 20, back at Camp Nou -but to go through we must perform and we have to deserve it. We can't rely on fate."JACKSON, Miss. (AP)  A high-profile former lawyer says he was a passenger on a twin-engine jet hours before it crashed in northern Mississippi, killing three people.Richard "Dickie" Scruggs told the Clarion Ledger in a story published Monday that he and his family flew aboard the plane Saturday from Colorado back to their home in Oxford, Mississippi. Pilot Tommy Nix, his wife Merline Nix and co-pilot Jarrod Holloway left Oxford moments later to fly to Alabama's Marion County-Rankin Fite Airport.Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Rick Breitenfeldt said the plane, a Rockwell Sabreliner 65, departed the University Oxford Airport at about 3 p.m. Saturday. Union County Sheriff Jimmy Edwards said his office received a call shortly after 5 p.m. Saturday that the plane had disappeared from radar.Edwards said investigators found the wreckage at about 9:30 p.m. Saturday between New Albany and Blue Springs. He said all three aboard were killed.The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash.Scruggs was a Navy pilot decades ago. He gained national prominence and became a multimillionaire with lawsuits against makers of asbestos and tobacco products in the 1990s. He spent time in federal prison and lost his law license after pleading guilty in 2008 in a Mississippi judicial bribery scheme.Since his release from prison, Scruggs has described himself publicly as a "disbarred and disgraced trial lawyer" and has paid education expenses for adults who left high school without earning a diploma.Scruggs told the newspaper that he learned about the plane crash Saturday when he got a text from an unknown number: "If this is Dickie Scruggs, please call me immediately."Scruggs said he called the number. The man on the other end was a pilot who lived nearby, Scruggs said. The plane lost communication east of Oxford, he told Scruggs, and he was trying to figure out what happened. The pilot thought Scruggs was on the plane when it went silent.Scruggs said Nix, who lived in Belmont, Mississippi, and Holloway, who lived in Booneville, Mississippi, were professional pilots. He said he had been on at least 50 to 100 flights with Nix as pilot and about a dozen flights with Holloway as pilot. He said Nix had taught Holloway to fly."They were really exceptional in their professionalism," Scruggs said.___This story has been corrected to show wreckage was found late Saturday.To read this article in one of Houston's most-spoken languages, click on the button below.AboutContactMonday's play at the Monte Carlo Masters saw Daniil Medvedev pull level with Roger Federer for wins this season as top seeds Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal learned the identity of their second-round opponents.Djokovic, champion at this event in 2013 and 2015, will take on Philipp Kohlschreiber after the German cruised past Taro Daniel 6-1 6-3.Nadal, meanwhile, is an 11-time winner in Monte Carlo  including in each of the past three years  and the second seed faces a showdown with compatriot Roberto Bautista Agut, who came from behind to oust John Millman 3-6 6-1 6-1.David Goffin, Marco Cecchinato and Diego Schwartzman were Monday's other notable winners as the ATP's biggest names enjoyed opening-round byes.MEDVEDEV MATCHES FEDERERA 6-1 6-1 thrashing of Joao Sousa saw Medvedev chalk up his 18th win on the ATP Tour this season, the joint-most alongside Federer.The Russian broke five times en route to a dominant victory and can now look forward to meeting Radu Albot in round two."It was a good match.

We don't know what's going to happen and that's an incentive for everyone."He's fine after the knock he had. He's in perfect shape for tomorrow."Ousmane Dembele, an unused substitute in the first leg, is in contention to join Messi and Luis Suarez in Barcelona's attack.The 21-year-old France winger completed over an hour on his return from a hamstring injury against Huesca and could start on Tuesday."He didn't play for four weeks but he will be able to participate in this game," Valverde said."We're not sure for how long. He played for around 70 minutes the other day and played well. He might start and he might not."Much of the belief that United can overturn the first-leg deficit has centred on the Premier League club's impressive last-16 fightback against Paris Saint-Germain, as well as their famous triumph over Bayern Munich in the 1999 final when now-manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored a stoppage-time winner at Camp Nou.Valverde, however, cares little for the influence of history."I'm more about writing my own destiny," he said. "Tomorrow we have to write our own destiny and so do Manchester United."There's no fear, just tremendous excitement. We're ready to go through knowing anything can happen. I think we're all aware a tough game awaits and we're all looking forward to it."PONCHATOULA, LA - Darron Landry is taking a trip down memory lane, looking at old photos of his little brother, who passed away in 1999.He was a talent, he was a two-way guy, Darron Landry said.

The county's refugee learners arrived from countries that include Vietnam, Bosnia, Somalia, Sudan and Syria.For the past 25 years, the school district has provided English as a Second Language Services through a language center plan that sends students to central locations.The district's ESL officials said that plans are underway to eliminate seven language facilities for elementary students that serve refugees and newcomers, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported."It's the refugee population and the refugee population has dwindled recently," said Karen Neal, interim director for ESL in the Fort Worth school district.In early April, 161 elementary students were being taught at language centers, but the number is projected to fall to 53 next by school year. ESL teachers will support campuses with large concentrations of English learners, according to the district.Plans are also in the works to close language centers at middle schools by the 2020-21 school year. The middle school language centers help students in sixth, seventh and eighth grades. In April, the district had 298 students in the middle school program. Next year, 25 teachers are expected to serve 84 students at seven sites."These numbers roll up hill," Neal said. "Because my numbers are dwindling at elementary, there aren't children to feed into middle school language centers. That also impacts my middle schools. If we serve third, fourth and fifth, if they come in as fifth-graders, they still have time in the system  we just aren't getting that many kids anymore."The district asserted the ESL instructors will not lose their job under the plan.Russell Smith, CEO of Refugee Services of Texas, said that his agency has been resettling fewer refugees. Smith's agency is the largest one of three serving Tarrant County.In 2016, the agency helped resettle 581 refugees in Fort Worth.

Prosecutors have said they intend to seek the death penalty.The Jackson County jury deliberated less than two hours after getting the case Monday morning. The defense did not call any witnesses or present any evidence during the weeklong trial, The Kansas City Star reported .At least today there is a solid assurance about what's going to happen now and that is Brandon Howell wouldn't be able to hurt anyone else again," said Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker.Patrick J. Berrigan and Molly Hastings, among several attorneys representing Howell, declined to comment after the verdicts.Relatives and friends of the victims hugged and cried after the verdicts were announced."We are certainly glad to have this over," said Ronald Sandhaus, the brother of victim Susan Choucroun. "It has been a long four and a half years, but the jury got it right and hopefully he is staring at five life sentences without parole."According to court records, the killings began when Howell tried to steal a classic Jaguar from the home of 80-year-old George Taylor and his wife, Anna Taylor. Police have said Howell couldn't get the car started and instead stole the Taylors' sports utility vehicle.Witnesses told police they saw the driver of the Taylors' vehicle stop in front of Choucroun's house next door. He got out and shot her in her driveway before leaving. Arriving officers found the Taylors severely beaten in their basement. They died a week later in a hospital.Two other potential witnesses to the theft  88-year-old Lorene Hurst and her son, 63-year-old Darrel Hurst  also were shot to death, possibly as they were returning from the grocery store.The SUV later was found abandoned near a Motel 6 in neighboring Platte County, where Howell is charged with assaulting three people. Howell was arrested that night walking along a freeway carrying a shotgun in his pants.Howell had long been on the radar of law enforcement. In 1998, the body of his classmate, 18-year-old Nick Travis, was found buried in the yard of a duplex in Kansas City, Missouri, that was being renovated by Howell's father. Howell was the last person seen with Travis and 16-year-old Tabitha Brewer before the sweethearts disappeared from Johnson County, Kansas. Brewer's body has never been found, although her partially burned purse was discovered in a trash container.While that case was under investigation.

Theyre like friends you might chat with. The wrentit and the Aberts towhee are like the neighbors you dont talk to much. As for the Hammonds flycatcher and the Brewers sparrow, Americans dont care much about them at all.Thats the word from a new study that aimed to define a range of relationships between people and birds across the United States, said Justin Schuetz, one of the authors.Results appear in a paper released Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. Schuetz, a biologist and independent researcher in Bath, Maine, did the work with Alison Johnston, whos affiliated with Cornell University in Ithaca, New YorkThe project included studying Google searches performed from 2008 to 2017 to learn about what Americans think about 621 bird species. Researchers knew where each search came from. They also knew the natural range of each species and how often it is sighted in specific places, based on a national database.One key question was whether the Google data revealed more interest in each species than one would expect in various locations, based on how often it is sighted in those places. Another question was how much the interest in each species was limited to its natural range, or spilled out beyond it.So birds in the celebrity category are those that attracted more Google attention than one would expect from how often theyre seen, and whose popularity extended outside of their natural range. They have a reputation beyond where they live, Schuetz explained.Next came the friends or enemies category, which included species that get more Google attention than expected, but mostly in the states where they live. As with the other categories, the researchers couldnt tell whether the searchers opinions of these familiar birds were positive or negative.Then came birds classified as neighbors, whose few Google searches were confined to where they live. Finally there were the strangers, birds that got little Google interest anywhere.The research also turned up other insights into what makes a species popular. Bigger bodies, colorful plumage and regular visits to birdfeeders helped. Species that served as mascots for professional sports teams reached celebrity status, but it wasnt clear whether being a mascot encouraged popularity or the other way around.The results also turned up some surprises. People seem to have an inordinate fascination with owls we couldnt account for entirely in our analysis, Schuetz said.Jeffrey Gordon, president of the American Birding Association, called the study a fascinating framework for trying to understand how people are relating to birds.I hope theyre able to use it to help people appreciate whats right in their own backyard, he said. Most of us just arent keyed in to what is literally at our doorstep.David Ringer, chief network officer for the National Audubon Society, also found the work interesting.Its great to see how much we know and love some species, and its provocative to see how much we still have to discover, he wrote in an email. I hope that many bird strangers will become friends, and neighbors will turn into celebrities.'___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education. The AP is solely responsible for all content.There is very little science behind most of the health claims made for CBD, the cannabis product turning up in cosmetics, foods and dietary supplements.With mainstream retailers Walgreens and CVS offering CBD skin products, its easy to believe there must be something special about the trendy ingredient. But the claims are largely unproven, quality control standards dont exist and the legal status of CBD-infused food is in doubt.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration plans to hold a public hearing May 31 to gather more information on the science, manufacturing and sale of cannabis compounds such as CBD.A look at what we know as U.S. regulators work out what will and wont be allowed:WHAT IS CBD?CBD is one of more than 100 compounds found in marijuana. Its extracted using alcohol or carbon dioxide in factories. Its added to oils, mixed into creams and lotions and sold in candies and liquid drops.Widely sold online, CBD now is going mainstream. Prices range from $12 to $150 an ounce at high-end shops.CBD often comes from a cannabis plant known as hemp, which is defined by the U.S. government as having less than 0.3% THC. Thats important because THC is what causes marijuanas mind-altering effect.CBD doesnt get people high, although it may be calming. Keep in mind some CBD products may contain THC, whether or not the label says so.People drug tested for work, addiction programs or because they take prescription opioids should take note: CBD products have caused people to fail urine drug screens.IS IT A MIRACLE CURE?If you believe the hype, CBD treats pain, relieves anxiety and both helps you sleep and keeps you focused.Most claims are based on studies in rats, mice or in test tubes. Some human research has been done, but in small numbers of people.One exception: For two rare seizure disorders, the evidence for CBD was strong enough to convince the FDA to approve GW Pharmaceuticals drug Epidiolex, which contains a purified form.The FDA has sent warning letters to companies marketing products with claims for CBDs effects on cancer, Alzheimers disease, fibromyalgia and drug addiction.Only drugs that have been reviewed by the FDA as safe and effective can make claims that they treat or prevent diseases or medical conditions. Many CBD producers attempt to sidestep the issue by using only vague language about general health and well-being.ANY SIDE EFFECTS?Scant research means not much is known about side effects either. In epilepsy research, CBD changed the way the body processed other drugs. That suggests CBD could interact with medications in ways we still dont know about.The most common side effects of the CBD drug Epidiolex include sleepiness, decreased appetite, diarrhea, increases in liver enzymes, exhaustion, rash and infections. The potential for liver injury and other risks can be handled with medical supervision, former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said earlier this month, but less is known about how that would be managed without oversight. And there are questions about overlap if multiple CBD products are used.IS IT LEGAL?For now, the FDA has said CBD is not allowed as an ingredient in food, drinks or dietary supplements.In stating its position, the FDA cited a provision of the law prohibiting food makers from using active drug ingredients or those still undergoing substantial research. But the agency doesnt have the resources to police all the CBD products that are already available, said Marc Scheineson, a former FDA official.Theyre not going to pull a thousand products from the market, he said.The FDAs authority is over interstate commerce, and local officials have taken differing approaches. In New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere, officials are warning eateries to stop selling it in food and drinks. Maine passed a law allowing it in foods and other products in the state.Skin creams and cosmetics may be on safer footing with the FDA, but that too remains uncertain, said Camille Gourdet of RTI International, a nonprofit research institute in Durham, North Carolina. Though cosmetics arent subject to premarket approval by the FDA, they could run afoul of regulations if they make specific health claims.Marijuana itself is illegal under federal law; most states that have legalized it allow marijuana-infused foods and candies, called edibles.ARE CBD LABELS ACCURATE?What you buy may contain much less CBD than the label states  or much more. It may include more THC than you want and it may be contaminated with mold or pesticides. Ask to see testing reports.A 2017 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found 70% of CBD products were mislabeled. Researchers used an independent lab to test 84 products from 31 companies.Youre really flying by the seat of your pants when you buy this stuff, said author Marcel Bonn-Miller of University of Pennsylvania.A product labeled as containing 100 milligrams of CBD may only have 5 milligrams or it may have 200, said Bonn-Miller, now an adviser for a company that sells CBD and other cannabis products. He did not work in the industry when he did the research.I wouldnt trust any of it until I knew independently it was safe, Bonn-Miller said.WHATS AHEAD?CBD research is planned or underway for cancer, autism, diabetic neuropathy, fibromyalgia, chronic pain, alcoholism with PTSD and psychiatric conditions. Results will take years, but some people arent waiting.They are vulnerable and really hoping to feel better, said Karen Hande, a nurse practitioner at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville.She became an expert in CBD because so many of her cancer patients were trying it. She tells them the evidence isnt enough to back the claims, but they want to believe something is going to work.___Follow APs complete marijuana coverage: https://apnews.com/Marijuana___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institutes Department of Science Education.

State officials will challenge a court ruling that revoked the water permit for a silver and copper mine proposed beneath a Montana wilderness area, a Department of Natural Resources and Conservation spokesman said Monday.Judge Kathy Seeley ruled state officials didnt adequately consider potential damage to nearby streams from Hecla Mining Co.s Rock Creek Mine northeast of Noxon.Attorneys for the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation plan to file an appeal, said agency spokesman John Grassy. He declined to offer further details.The April 9 ruling does not affect the ability of Idaho-based Hecla to conduct exploratory work for the mine, which the U.S. Forest Service gave preliminary approval to last year, company spokesman Luke Russell said Monday.Environmental groups represented by Earthjustice had argued that streams within the Cabinet Mountain Wilderness are so ecologically valuable that they deserve the greatest protections available under law.Seeley agreed and in her April 9 order sent the matter back to the Department of Natural Resources Conservation for reconsideration.Its great news for wilderness, rivers and streams the critical habitat they provide for fish and wildlife, said Bonnie Gestring with Earthworks, one of the groups that challenged the water permit after it was issued in January 2018.Rock Creek would employ about 300 people and cover almost 500 acres.Montana regulators in a separate case have asked a judge to block Hecla CEO Phillips Baker, Jr. from exploring or opening new mines. They allege hes in violation of the states bad actor law because of ongoing pollution from a mining company where Baker once worked.New York Red Bulls midfielder Kaku was sent off with a red card in the final moments of the Red Bulls 2-2 draw with Sporting Kansas City last night, after he kicked a ball in frustration and it struck a fan in the front row. The fan reportedly was left with a bloody face and needing medical attention. According to Red Bulls midfielder Daniel Royer, Kaku didnt mean to hit anyone. [Kaku] definitely meant to hit the board in front of the first row of seats, Royer said, per ESPN. Kaku, who appeared angry about a botched pass just before he launched the ball into the stands, misfired, hitting the fan and sparking a shoving match on the sideline. At around the 17-second mark in the video above, behind the players scrum, you can see a fan slumped over and the people next to him gesturing to the usher for help.After the game, Kaku tweeted out several apologies. AdvertisementWith the red card, Kaku will automatically miss the teams next game, but hell likely face a longer suspension for endangering a fan. This morning, the Red Bulls put out a statement about the incident:The New York Red Bulls organization does not condone the type of behavior displayed near the end of Sunday nights match in Kansas City. We hold everyone in our organization to a high standard of conduct. The matter will continue to be discussed internally and we will have no further comment at this time.AdvertisementThe fan, at least, appeared to be ok after the game.Reporter at Deadspin.With a tight 1-0 home win over Sheffield Wednesday this weekend, Leeds United took a big step toward sealing promotion to the Premier League next season. In the explosion of joy following Jack Harrisons 65th minute goal, one Leeds fan exploded his ankle during his raucous celebration, which required a surgery that the madman put off by waiting until after the match was over before going to the hospital.Heres a photo of the fan, identified as 18-year-old Matt Richardson, after he screwed up his ankle but before he left the stadium, tweeted out by @ArchaeoWill. WARNING: This is pretty gross:Richardson himself tweeted another photo of his foot once he was at the hospital:The Yorkshire Evening Post caught up with Richardson and let him explain himself. Here, he lays out what happened:I jumped up, ran down the steps, I missed my step and fell over, Richardson said.Next thing I know, I look at my ankle and its like falling off.I looked down and I thought: I probably need to go hospital but my main priority was to carry on watching the game.AdvertisementRichardson said he did flag the on-site paramedics over, who naturally advised him to leave immediately to get his foot checked out, but he refused. I was more interested in the fact Leeds are going to the Premier League! Richardson told the Post. After the final whistle, the stadiums support staff lugged him away:The overly fanatical teen also talked about how he was able to snap a bone in his leg and still sit there cheerily for about a half-hour before going to the hospital:I managed to crack a smile because for so many years Ive gone to Elland Road and watched absolute rubbish.Finally we have team with passion and desire to win, and that makes me proud to be a Leeds fan, so the passion overcame the pain.AdvertisementWith only four matches left in the Championship season, Leeds are currently in the second of the tables two automatic promotion places, clear of third place by three points. Maybe it really is worth potentially losing your foot (though it seems like Richardson will be fine) to watch your beloved club put one foot of its own into the Premier League.[Yorkshire Evening Post]WriterAfter working hard and officially earning All-State status just a couple of weeks ago from the Oklahoma Girls Basketball Coaches Association, Ardmores Sierra Gordon and Sulphurs Payton Row decided to double down on their senior honors earlier this week.After working hard and officially earning All-State status just a couple of weeks ago from the Oklahoma Girls Basketball Coaches Association, Ardmores Sierra Gordon and Sulphurs Payton Row decided to double down on their senior honors earlier this week.Both senior standouts were given another All-State award, as they were both named to the Oklahoma Coaches Association All-State list for girls basketball.Gordon was named to the Large West squad, while Row was named to the Small West squad.The 2019 OCA All-State games will take place on July 24 at the Mabee Center on the campus of Oral Roberts University in Tulsa.It was a banner season for Gordon as she helped lead the Lady Tigers back to the Class 5A state tournament for the second time in three seasons.Gordon finished her season averaging 17.3 points per game to go with 3.3 assists, 2.6 steals and 2.4 rebounds per game.She was also a member of the 2017-18 All-Ardmoreite girls basketball team, and a Class 5A selection for the Large West on the All-Star by Class team as well.As for Row, she completed a stellar senior season for the Lady Bulldogs, helping them reach the state tournament for the first time since 2013 this season.She was named to the All-Tournament team for the Class 3A state tournament, as well as the MVP for the Madill Winter Classic.

			Even by the standards of a line of work that can be dangerous, it was an unusually violent attack.			
						London Police headquarters (File photo)						


Even by the standards of a line of work that can be dangerous, it was an unusually violent attack.A London woman was attacked with a stun gun and robbed early Monday, with her vehicle taken, by a man shed met through an online advertisement, leaving police looking for a suspect and warning those involved in the sex trade to be wary.One womens advocate said shes worried the violence could be the fallout of a recent decision by London police to publish the names of johns, or men accused of buying sex.Jessie Rodger said she had major concerns about the recent police decision to start naming johns, because theres peer-reviewed evidence that approach will increase violence and decrease the safety of sex workers.I dont know if there is any way for us to know, but this will always come up for me and for our organization to wonder when violence happens toward sex workers, if this is part of it, said Rodger, executive director of Anova, an organization that provides support and shelter to victims of sexual violence and abuse.London police were looking for a suspect in the assault, which happened shortly after midnight Monday at a home in the area of Wellington and Simcoe streets, just south of the downtown.The new police practice to publicly name men accused of buying sex makes the men reluctant to give their names when trying to meet sex workers, Rodger said. Men who trade in fake names stop sex trade workers from being able to speak to one another about potential clients to assess their own safety.If they give a fake name, (the workers) dont know, Rodger said. Their ability to vet is down.Police, who werent immediately available for followup questions about the implications of the attack, say a man went to the home after communicating with a woman through an online ad.Hand-held stun guns, which deliver a jolt of electricity, are prohibited weapons in Canada, their use legally restricted to law enforcement agencies.The woman in Mondays attack had minor injuries and didnt seek any medical attention, police said.Police Chief John Pare recently changed the city police policy about naming johns, a move to help fight human trafficking in the sex trade.London police previously had withheld the names of accused johns, even in human trafficking investigations, saying most would avoid a criminal record by attending a diversion program to educate them about the pitfalls of the sex-trade industry.Decades of research shows that naming johns puts sex trade workers at risk, a London sex-work researcher has said.I dont know how the decision was made. It is a perfect illustration of ignoring research in favour of moralizing, said Treena Orchard, a health studies researcher at Western University, told The Free Press earlier this year.Worried about being named, johns will take sex workers to more isolated or hidden places. Sex workers facing a declining number of clients will be forced to lower their prices, work longer hours or take greater risks with unknown johns.Rodger said shes received several alerts about men who are threats to sex-trade workers over the last few months.This one is a little more concerning and violent, but I wouldnt say its super-uncommon, she said. (I have) absolute concern for women who participate in sex work, absolute concern on how we support and we make sure they are safe.In a statement Monday, SafeSpace London, a collective of sex workers and advocates for the decriminalization of prostitution, said getting warned about a violent predator is great, but much more is needed to make their working conditions safer.We need decriminalization, the group said in its statement. It is a first and essential step, while we address the other systemic issues that reduce the likelihood someone is in sex work from a place of consent.Police described the suspect in Mondays attack as black, between 25 and 40 years of age, about five-foot-eight and 200 pounds, with short hair. Police say he was clean-shaven and wore a black and grey toque and a black hooded sweatshirt.The vehicle reported stolen in Mondays attack is a 2019 red Toyota RAV4, with licence plate CHDY928.Anyone with information is asked to contact London police at 519 661-5670.With files by Randy Richmondhrivers@postmedia.comTwitter.com/HeatheratLFP365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

Joey Hauser will have three years of eligibility after sitting out next season."We are thankful for all that Sam and Joey contributed to our program and University during their time at Marquette and wish them the best of luck in the future," head coach Steve Wojciechowski said in a statement. "We have a tremendous group of returning players and are extremely excited about the upcoming season and future of our program."Sam, a 6-foot-8 junior, averaged 14.9 points and 7.2 rebounds this season. He shot 40.2 percent from 3-point range, marking the third season in a row he's made at least 40 percent of his 3-pointers.Joey, a 6-foot-9 freshman, averaged 9.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game in his first season at Marquette. He also shot 42.5 percent from 3.Both players are officially in the transfer portal, sources told ESPN.With leading scorer Markus Howard back, Wojciechowski expected to have one of the best teams in the country next season. Without the Hausers, the Golden Eagles will likely fall toward the back end of the preseason top 25.Meanwhile, the Hausers will be two of the most sought-after transfers on the market.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?

						Exeter native Logan Finch, 16, recently qualified to this years World Scooter Championship, which will be held in July in Barcelona, Spain. (Submitted photo)						


Its a sport you may not even know exists, but its one in which a 16-year-old athlete from Southwestern Ontario is drawing raves internationally.Exeters Logan Finch will represent Canada at the World Scooter Championship in Barcelona, Spain, in July. Yes, scooter championships.Similar to skateboarding, the sport consists of riding through a course of ramps and other obstacles while performing tricks on a scooter.Competitors are scored on factors such as the complexity of their tricks, their style and speed, and their use of the course.Although skateboarding remains the more popular of the two sports, scootering  as it is more commonly known  has been gaining popularity over the last few years, especially in the United States, Australia and parts of Europe.This is the first time Finch, who has been practising the sport for about five years, has made it to the international level after falling short the last couple of years in the qualifying rounds in California  something he says made qualifying this year that much sweeter.Im pretty happy, he said. Ive been wanting to (qualify) to this event almost for as long as I have been scootering, and it feels pretty good to know that I will be competing with the best in the world.Finch secured his spot last month after finishing second at a qualifying round held in nearby Zurich that attracted 25 athletes from North America.Finch said he started scootering simply because he thought it was fun.He said he would go on YouTube and watch videos of other people to learn new tricks and then practised them on his own.

In short order, he was sharing videos of his own tricks on social media, which allowed him to get his first sponsor when he was 12 years old. From there, Finch went on to participate in competitions across the province and, eventually, North America.Since theres no age limit, Finch, at 16, will likely be one of the younger, if not the youngest, participants at the Barcelona competition.His parents, Lori and Bill, and his older brother Mitchell, who they say are Finchs No. 1 supporters, will travel with him.For us, its been awesome to watch Logan grow from an intermediate rider to pro to now qualifying at worlds, Lori Finch said. Its totally amazing.As for his own expectations, Logan Finch says he will be taking this event as a learning opportunity.I just kind of want to have fun there, he said.jjuha@postmedia.comTwitter.com/JuhaatLFPress365 Bloor St East, Toronto, ON, M4W3L4, www.postmedia.com

Ils viennent aussi avec beaucoup de supporters. J'ai beaucoup de respect pour Madagascar. C'est un pays que j'adore. Il y a beaucoup de bons footballeurs l-bas. Il y a aussi le Burundi qui a sorti le Gabon en liminatoires. Il ne faudra pas sous-estimer les Burundais. En tout cas, on les prendra trs au srieux  a expliqu Gernot Rohr, entraneur du Nigeria aprs le tirage au sort. Mais  deux mois de cette joute continentale, deux joueurs malgaches sont blesss  savoir Lalaina Nomenjanahary touch  la cheville et Zotsara Randriambololona au genou droit. Comme les Barea sont maintenant fixs sur leurs adversaires, les frus du ballon rond et les joueurs attendent une prparation digne d'une quipe qualifie  la CAN. En sport, il n'y a pas de magie, on ne rcolte que ce qu'on mrite ... .Calendrier22 juin : Madagascar contre Guine.27 juin : Madagascar contre Burundi.30 Juin : Madagascar Contre Nigeria.Lire l'article original sur Midi Madagasikara.Copyright  2019 Midi Madagasikara.

 2019 AllAfricaPolitique de confidentialitContactez-nousMAXWELL - A week off did the Collins-Maxwell girls soccer team a lot of good.After getting overwhelmed by Gilbert in their season opener on April 4, the Spartans came out determined against Ballard April 11 in Maxwell.Collins-Maxwell took advantage of two quick goals midway through the first half and withstood a late Ballard charge to pull off a 3-1 victory.Last season, the Spartans fell to the Bombers on a last-minute goal. That motivated them to get on the same page and make huge gains following their 10-0 setback to Gilbert in the opener.They only had one goal and didnt score in the last five minutes, so that helps, Collins-Maxwell forward Caitlyn Bruntz said. Our first win against Ballard feels really good.Ballard had the momentum early, but Collins-Maxwell started to take control 10 minutes into the game.The Spartans caught a huge break 19 minutes, 55 seconds into the game when they were awarded a penalty kick. Bruntz converted to get her team on the board.Less than two minutes later Collins-Maxwell struck again, this time with Tori Bienfang finding the net to put all the momentum on the Spartans side.This game was about slowing it down and getting our crosses in because against Gilbert we had zero, Bruntz said. We really tried to feed the ball better to our forwards, and get those crosses and through balls in.Bienfang established herself as a big weapon against the Bombers in just her second varsity start to complement Bruntz, the teams leading returning scorer from a year ago.Shes like a bulldozer, Bruntz said. She just plows people over  very aggressive. We need that against teams that are aggressive like Ballard.Collins-Maxwell maintained that 2-0 lead at the half. Ballard started putting up a better fight in the second half, but at the 61:29 mark of the game, Bruntz nailed a beautiful cross shot from midrange that made it past Bomber keeper Sierra Knight for a 3-0 Spartan advantage.Ballard picked up the pace in the final 15 minutes.Brooke Loewe got the Bombers on the board with 10:09 remaining. The Bombers kept up the pressure the rest of the way, but with keeper Elise Robertson directing traffic for the defense, the Spartans held Ballard scoreless the rest of the way.I think communication went way better this time, Robertson said. I think we played more together tonight.Robertson finished with 12 saves. Both teams had 13 shots on goal.Collins-Maxwell improved to 1-1 and Ballard suffered its first defeat, dropping to 2-1. After struggling for most of the first 60 minutes, Bomber head girls soccer coach Brent Emerson was happy with how his team fought back to make things interesting down the stretch.Ive got to give them a lot of credit, but the good thing for our kids is we really battled the second half, Emerson said. We got a lot of shots on goal; we just didnt get them in the right places. This was a good test for us and a good kind of wakeup call to go forward. Weve got a lot of big games on the horizon.Knight made 10 saves at keeper for Ballard. The Bombers must regroup quickly as they travel to Boone tomorrow.Collins-Maxwells next outing is at Grand View Christian next Tuesday.Collins-Maxwell 3, Ballard 1B 0 1 - 1CM 2 1 - 3ScoringFirst halfCM - Caitlyn Bruntz, 19:55.CM - Tori Bienfang, 21:01.Second halfCM - Bruntz, 61:29.B - Brooke Loewe, 69:51.

Theres not much to be sure of when it comes to the No. 58 pick of the 2019 NFL draft. Right now, its owned by the Dallas Cowboys and unless they make a trade to change things, it will be their first selection of draft weekend. Theres not much certainty beyond that, and certainly no assurances of which prospects will be available for them to choose from.That changes the complexion of this years draft process. Dallas hasnt been without a first rounder for a decade, after giving up their 2009 first-round pick to Detroit in the trade for WR Roy Williams. That year, they bailed on the second round of a weak draft class and ended up getting a haul to be forgotten. Hopefully that isnt the sentence handed down to Dallas this year. Will there be the necessary talent left at No. 58 to avoid such miserableness?Dane Brugler of The Athletic (subscription required) has released his annual draft guide, essential and required reading for all and as per usual, at the end is his Top 100 list.While players ranked below No. 58 are able to be taken before Dallas gets on the clock, it feels like a safe bet theyll be able to pick and choose from those prospects in the 10 slots before 58 and the 10 after; call it 10 Up, 10 Down.Heres a quick look at those names.49. JUAN THORNHILL S Virginia
50. JULIAN LOVE CB Notre Dame
51. KELVIN HARMON WR NC State
52. NKEAL HARRY WR Arizona State
53. DANIEL JONES QB Duke

62. HAKEEM BUTLER WR Iowa State
63. KALEB McGARY OT Washington
64. ANDY ISABELLA WR Massachusetts
65. JAHLANI TAVAI LB Hawaii
66. JOEJUAN WILLIAMS CB Vanderbilt
67. JJ ARCEGA-WHITESIDE WR Stanford
68. AMANI HOOKER S IowaThe names bolded were invited to Dallas as either 30 visits or part of Dallas Day. There are 4 safeties in this range, which is a position the Cowboys are clearly interested in this draft process. There are also two cornerbacks listed, in case Dallas wants to plan ahead for the losses they could take on at the position as early as next season.On the surface the Cowboys dont need a wideout either, but four of their top five receivers are in the final year of their deals, including No. 1 Amari Cooper whom the club still hasnt extended. Over 25 percent of this list are wideouts.

                                            Smoke could be seen billowing out from the top of the medieval cathedral, as flames leapt out besides its two bell towers, a Reuters witness said.
                                        PARIS - Notre-Dame Cathedral went up in flames on Monday in a roaring blaze that devastated the Parisian landmark, one of Frances most visited places.Flames burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and quickly engulfed the spire, which collapsed.A huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area.Everything is collapsing, a police officer near the scene said as the entire roof of the cathedral continued to burn.Firefighters cleared the area around the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Buildings around were evacuated.President Emmanuel Macron cancelled an address to the nation that he had been due to give later on Monday evening. A presidential official said Macron was to go to the scene of the blaze.A terrible fire is under way at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo said on Twitter.France 2 television reported that police were treating the incident as an accident.The cathedral, which dates back to the 12th century, features in Victor Hugos classic novel The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. It attracts millions of tourists every year.Notre-Dame was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding and bronze statues were removed last week for works.

                                            After citizens from Syria, those from Venezuela were the second-largest group among the 57,000 people who asked for asylum in February in the EU, Switzerland and Norway, according to official figures.

                                        BRUSSELS - Venezuelans and other Latin Americans are filing a surge in requests for asylum in European countries, which are more accustomed to dealing with migrants from the Middle East, Central Asia and Africa, figures showed Monday.After citizens from Syria, those from Venezuela were the second-largest group among the 57,000 people who asked for asylum in February in the EU, Switzerland and Norway, according to official figures.Venezuelans fleeing their crisis-hit country filed more asylum applications than Afghans, Iraqis and Nigerians, the next-biggest groups, the European Asylum Support Office said in a statement."The fact that Venezuelans lodged more applications than Afghans represents a noticeable development," EASO said. "Venezuelan nationals had never lodged such a high number of applications in a single month ever before."There were 3,995 Venezuelans who applied in February, up 51% from January and nearly triple the figure a year ago, EASO added.In February, Venezuela saw a worsening of a political, economic and humanitarian crisis resulting from the contested re-election of President Nicolas Maduro.EASO said Syrians, who have been fleeing the eight-year civil war, lodged some 5,393 applications, slightly fewer than in January. Afghan applications decreased to December 2018 levels, even if the number was up 31% from a year ago.EASO said 1,937 Colombians, 731 Salvadorans, 616 Nicaraguans and 592 Hondurans filed for asylum in February. There were also 351 requests from citizens of Haiti, 323 from Peru, 112 from Cuba and 73 from Guatemala.Most, it said, are seeking to live in Spain.EAS0 said the Colombian applications also amounted to a record high, up 47% from January and more than triple the number from a year earlier.Colombia now ranks tenth in the nationalities seeking asylum in Europe.The number of Nicaraguan applicants also increased sharply, from just nine in February 2018, to 616 in February this year.In 2015, the European Union faced its worst migration crisis since World War II, with more than one million people entering the bloc from Syria and other countries in the Middle East and Africa.The EU has sharply cut the migration flow through cooperation with Turkey and Libya, which have been staging areas for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.

                                        ADDIS ABABA - The African Union on Monday threatened to suspend Sudan following last week's coup that saw Omar al-Bashir ousted by the military after nearly three decades in power.If the junta fails to hand power to civilians within 15 days, the AU will suspend "the participation of the Sudan in all AU's activities until the restoration of constitutional order," the body's Peace and Security Council (PSC) said in a statement.Bashir ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 30 years before he was deposed last week following mass protests that have rocked the country since December.The protesters have remained in the streets, demanding a return to civilian rule from the military council that's replaced Bashir.The AU echoed the protesters' demands, calling the military intervention a "coup d'Etat, which (the PSC) strongly condemns."The body, which has 55 member states, added that "a military-led transition would be completely contrary to the aspirations of the people of Sudan."

The month of April does bring the NFL draft, but before any of that happens offseason workouts get going across the league. A few weeks after several teams got going, the Dallas Cowboys began today. The workouts can be used as a tone setter for the bulk of the team and it is a potential spot for anyone looking for a new contract to begin holding out.Among those in attendance was running back Ezekiel Elliott. Some news outlets had floated the idea Elliott could hold out and stay away from team activities as he seeks a contract extension. Just like he has been through his first three years, he was there on time with no issues.The practices are voluntary, but many teams usually have some of their contract tied to players showing up to the offseason workouts like this one.The Cowboys have the reverse dynamic in play: Zack Martin, Tyron Smith, Travis Frederick, Tyrone Crawford, La'el Collins, Allen Hurns and Sean Lee all have a $500K de-escalator clause in their contracts for not participating in offseason workouts. https://t.co/MMVJzSBq24 Field Yates (@FieldYates) April 15, 2019There are three phases to offseason workouts, with this one lasting two weeks and where the only interaction with team officials are with strength and conditioning coaches. After the two weeks, then comes phase two which is more or less a teaching session for three weeks, then the final phase which involves team activities.The sessions are limited per the CBA to 90 minutes.While a large number of players have been at The Star working out for the last month, the Cowboys officially start Phase 1 of their offseason program today in which they can work out with the strength and conditioning coaches for the next two weeks. https://t.co/OUjS0XPu7B Todd Archer (@toddarcher) April 15, 2019Now that superstar defensive end Demarcus Lawrence got his gigantic bag full of money, that story no longer has any legs to run with, but it is interesting to see who shows up to these programs. Thankfully one of the people that there was a slight concern on showing, Ezekiel Elliott, did in fact show up and was ready to work.In case you didn't believe all of the reports that Zeke was showing up to the offseason program he posted it on Instagram too pic.twitter.com/gfuuiBJ8GZ Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) April 15, 2019Elliott is on the fourth year of his rookie deal, but with being a first-round pick (No. 4 overall in 2016), the team has a fifth-year option that they will likely exercise before the deadline the first week of May.You can follow Ryan Welch on Twitter@Rywelch.

                                        INDIANA - Pete Buttigieg, the millennial-aged mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who has enjoyed a surge in opinion polls and a torrent of media coverage, formally launched a bid on Sunday for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.It is time to walk away from the politics of the past and toward something totally different, he said at a launch event in South Bend.No potential contender in the burgeoning Democratic field has seen as rapid a rise in the early stages of the campaign as Buttigieg, who has gone from obscure Midwestern politician to top-tier contender in a matter of weeks.At 37, Buttigieg becomes the youngest entrant in a field that features 77-year-old US Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and, likely soon, 76-year-old former Vice President Joe Biden - a contrast Buttigieg has embraced.I recognise the audacity of doing this as a Midwestern millennial mayor, he told the crowd.More than a little bold at age 37  to seek the highest office in the land.The man known as Mayor Pete has styled himself as the voice of the millennial generation, often talking about what the United States might look like decades from now.I take that long view because I have to, Buttigieg said. I come from that generation that grew up with school shootings as the norm, the generation that produced the bulk of the troops in the post-9/11 conflicts, the generation that is going to be on the business end of climate change for as long as we live.Buttigieg is the first openly gay major presidential candidate, which has given him inroads into a Democratic base that increasingly values diversity and progressivism.I just announced I'm running for president of the United States. Join in and donate if you can. It's going to be an amazing ride and I can't wait to be on it with you all the way to the White House: https://t.co/edZnUvfc2I pic.twitter.com/OTi0YsAG5RDuring the event, he frequently mentioned his husband, Chasten, and spoke of the struggle to legalise same-sex marriage.Our marriage exists by the grace of a single vote on the US Supreme Court, he said.As mayor of South Bend since 2012, he has presided over an economic turnaround that has brought new investment into the struggling northwestern Indiana industrial town, an achievement likely to be a central plank of his presidential campaign.Indeed, his kick-off event was held inside the cavernous former plant that once made Studebaker autos. It closed in 1963 and only now is being redeveloped.Polls of voters in Iowa and New Hampshire released last week showed Buttigieg in third place in both early-voting states, although still well behind Biden and Sanders. Buttigieg raised $7 million in the first quarter of the year, surpassing more established rivals such as US Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.More than a dozen Democrats have announced a run for the chance to take on President Donald Trump, a Republican, in the November 2020 general election. Democratic voters will begin the process of selecting a nominee in a series of contests beginning early next year.A former Rhodes Scholar, consultant for the firm McKinsey and Co and US Navy reservist who served in Afghanistan, Buttigieg has the kind of background that could appeal to both moderates and progressives in the party.But questions will persist about whether the mayor of an Indiana city of 100,000 residents is ready to run a nation of 330 million.

                                            The German case comes nearly a year after the United States filed charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German carmakers emissions cheating.

                                        FRANKFURT/BERLIN - German prosecutors charged former Volkswagen  boss Martin Winterkorn with fraud on Monday over his role in the carmakers manipulation of diesel emissions testing, more than three years after the scandal came to light.The German case comes nearly a year after the United States filed charges against Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the German carmakers emissions cheating.The prosecutors office in the German city of Braunschweig said in a statement that Winterkorn and four other managers faced charges. It did not give the names of the other four or say whether they were still employed by Volkswagen.Winterkorns lawyer, Felix Doerr, said he could not comment on the charges because he had been denied access to important case files.A spokesman for Winterkorn, who resigned shortly after the scandal came to light and said at the time he was stunned by the scale of misconduct, did not respond to a request for comment.Volkswagen admitted in September 2015 to having used illegal engine control software to cheat US pollution tests, triggering a global backlash against diesel and costing the carmaker 29 billion euros so far ($33 billion).Volkswagens current chief executive Herbert Diess, who only joined the carmaker in July 2015 and became CEO a year ago, said he was not among those charged.I am not among the accused. I do not expect to be charged, Diess said, speaking on the sidelines of the Shanghai auto show.The events took place between November 2006 and September 2015, the prosecutors said, adding that Winterkorn had failed in his duty to inform European and US authorities after it became clear in May 2014 that diesel engines had been manipulated.Former Chief Executive Dr. Martin Winterkorn is being charged with a particularly serious case of fraud, a violation of the law against unfair competition and breach of fiduciary trust, the prosecutors office said in a statement.He also neglected to inform customers of the illegal software and did not prevent the continued installation of such software, the prosecutors alleged.They added that this had resulted in Volkswagen being slapped with much higher fines in Germany and the United States than would have been the case had he acted.Criminal proceedings against the carmaker over the rigged tests had already resulted in a one billion euro fine in June last year, marking one of the highest ever punitive payments imposed by German authorities against a company.Volkswagen said it would not comment because the company was not a party to the proceedings against individuals and that the Braunschweig criminal case against the company itself had been closed.While Winterkorn has already been charged by US authorities, he remains in Germany, which does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in US courts.In a related case, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Winterkorn last month, saying US investors were informed too late about the Volkswagen diesel emissions scandal, alleging massive fraud.The Braunschweig prosecutors said people accused of particularly serious fraud could face up to 10 years in prison in Germany.Alongside Winterkorn, four more managers were being charged on counts including major fraud and unfair competition, the statement said.They said that investigations into another 36 suspects in the diesel emissions scandal were ongoing and it was unclear when they would be wrapped up.

Chief selector MSK Prasad explains why India picked Dinesh Karthik over Rishabh Pant as the backup keeper (1:20)There was no place for Rishabh Pant or Ambati Rayudu in India's 15-man World Cup squad, but KL Rahul, Dinesh Karthik, Vijay Shankar and Ravindra Jadeja got the selectors' nod.The meeting to pick the team took place in Mumbai on Monday and was attended by India captain Virat Kohli and the five-man selection panel led by MSK Prasad.The squad: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma (vice capt), Shikhar Dhawan, KL Rahul, Vijay Shankar, MS Dhoni (wk), Kedar Jadhav, Dinesh Karthik, Yuzvendra Chahal, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah, Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami.Who will be the No. 4?For the past few months, both Kohli and Prasad had stressed that the World Cup squad was virtually "sorted" barring one spot: The No. 4 spot in the batting order. India have tried as many as 11 batsmen in that position since the 2017 Champions Trophy held in England.Kohli wants a No. 4 batsman with both the skill and temperament to inject momentum into the innings, especially if India are setting a target. Ambati Rayudu, Pant, Vijay and Karthik emerged as the main contenders for the spot and the selectors have now shortlisted Vijay, Karthik, Kedar Jadhav and if need be Rahul to perform that important role."After that Champions Trophy [in 2017] we have tried quite a few middle-order batsmen, which also includes Dinesh Karthik; we also tried Shreyas Iyer and Manish Pandey. We did give a few more chances to Rayudu, but what Vijay Shankar offers is three dimensions. Apart from his batting, he can bowl; if the conditions are suitable, overcast, which we might encounter in England, he might bowl a bit and he's a fantastic fielder. That's the thing that went in favour of Vijay Shankar."We are looking at him at No. 4 to begin with. With Dinesh Karthik in and also Kedar Jadhav in, we have plenty of options at that No. 4 right now."India's vice-captain Rohit Sharma had also put forward MS Dhoni's name at No. 4, although he insisted it was a "personal" choice. Prasad said that they had looked at all options in the meeting and the unanimous decision was to stick with Shankar at No. 4, at least at the start of the World Cup."It (Dhoni at No. 4) was discussed," Prasad said. "But I don't think that was the point. The point discussed is that Vijay Shankar will bat at No. 4 and so can Kedar Jadhav and we also have a role for KL [Rahul] somewhere." Prasad clarified that Rahul would be the third opener and will only be brought into the middle order if all other options failed.Karthik v PantWhy Karthik and not Pant was a question directed at Prasad more than once at the media briefing. And Prasad explained that though Pant was "almost there", the selectors had more faith in Karthik handling the pressure of "crunch" matches."It's definitely a case where we have debated at length and all of us in unison felt that either Rishabh Pant or DK [Karthik] will only come into the playing XI if Mahi [Dhoni] is injured. If it is a crucial match, like a quarter-final or a semi-final or like an important game, wicketkeeping also matters. So that's the only reason that we went ahead with Dinesh Karthik. Otherwise Rishabh Pant was almost there."However, the biggest factor that worked against Pant was his struggle in finishing games for Delhi Capitals in IPL 2019; something that had also happened in final ODI against Australia in March, when he walked in to bat early with India chasing 273, but fell for a run-a-ball 16."That is exactly what we have discussed," Prasad said. "Under pressure, we have seen Dinesh Karthik finishing matches. That's one reason that scored for him."Despite his promise as a hard-hitting batsman, Pant's wicketkeeping has not convinced everybody - including Prasad. "You can say that, you can say that, but the situation that was discussed among the selection committee is one of them will play in the XI provided MS [Dhoni] is injured. So under such situations, in crunch matches, who is the best guy who can handle the pressure? That is the reason that we went in favour of Dinesh Karthik. Otherwise Pant is full of talent. We have a lot of time for him. It is just unfortunate that he has missed out."Three spinners against fourth specialist fast bowlerThe defending champions Australia announced their World Cup squad on the same day as India and they picked as many as five fast bowlers. India though have settled for only three - Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Mohammed Shami.It appears that the fourth seamer's spot has gone to Jadeja, who has been included in case the wristspinners Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal suffer drops in form, which can happen in a tournament like the World Cup where each team plays nine games during the league phase alone."In the last one-and-a-half years, these two wristspinners who have won us games," Prasad said. "But there might be a situation where you might require an additional allrounder in the playing XI, which Jadeja brings in. In the second part of the tournament, where the wickets may be a bit more dry, that is where we felt Jadeja will come in handy. That's the reason why he's been picked."Also, the selectors believe that with four allrounders in the squad - including Hardik Pandya and Vijay, who bowl seam up - India can often field an XI with as many as seven strong bowling options. Also, a BCCI press release said four additional quicks - Navdeep Saini, Avesh Khan, Khaleel Ahmed and Deepak Chahar - will be traveling to the UK "to assist the Indian team in their World Cup preparation" and they could well be on standby in case of any problems to the three frontline quicks.To help make this website better, to improve and personalize your experience and for advertising purposes, are you happy to accept cookies and other technologies?Who will make India's 15 for the World Cup?

Rodgers Ssekawoko Muhumuza, left, checked Owamani Bruce for pneumonia with a portable ultrasound scanner in the Kabale district in western Uganda.CreditCreditSupported byBy Donald G. McNeil Jr.Photographs by Esther Ruth MbabaziBUSHORO, Uganda  Lying on a church pew with his arm over his head, 6-year-old Gordon Andindagaye whimpered a bit  in fear, not pain  as Dr. William A. Cherniak slowly swept a small ultrasound scanner up and down his chest.Dr. Cherniak and Rodgers Ssekawoko Muhumuza, the Ugandan clinical officer he was training, stared at the iPhone into which the scanner was plugged, watching Gordons lung expand and contract.O.K., Dr. Cherniak finally said. What do you recommend?Gordon had a persistent cough and swollen lymph nodes, and looked tired and unwell. As other boys ran around outside, kicking a soccer ball made of rags and twine, he clung weakly to his mother. The scan on the iPhones screen suggested his lungs had fluid in them.As Dr. Cherniak nodded approval, Mr. Muhumuza prescribed an antibiotic, and ordered blood tests to rule out tuberculosis, malaria and H.I.V. He arranged for Gordon and his mother to get a ride to a local clinic for an X-ray and a night of observation.Dr. Cherniak, an emergency medicine specialist from Canada, said he would upload the scan that evening so an ultrasound specialist in Toronto could double-check the diagnosis: early-stage pneumonia.[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]The diagnosis was made possible by a new invention that Dr. Cherniak hopes will revolutionize front-line global medicine: a hand-held ultrasound scanner called the Butterfly iQ.The Butterfly is about the size of an electric shaver. It is battery-powered and contains microchips rather than piezoelectric crystals, so it usually wont break if dropped. (That was accidentally tested a few times during a week that a reporter spent in rural Uganda with Dr. Cherniaks team.)For Butterfly Network, the Connecticut company that makes it, the profitable target customers are doctors and nurses who can afford a $2,000 device that fits in a coat pocket and is as portable as a stethoscope.But the scanner also has huge potential in rural Africa, Asia and Latin America, where the nearest X-ray machine may be hours away and the only CT and MRI scanners may be in the nations capital.That was my real motivation for making it, said Jonathan Rothberg, Butterflys founder, who initially pursued the goal because one of his daughters had a disease that caused kidney cysts needing regular scans. Two-thirds of the worlds population gets no imaging at all, he added. When you put something on a chip, the price goes down and you democratize it.The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is one of his backers, as are the investment arms of other family philanthropies.My team is engineers and computer scientists, he said. Wed love to be able to save lives the way doctors do, but we cant  so every tweet from Africa about the Butterfly is an incredible adrenaline shot for us.He has donated scanners to medical charities working in 13 low-income countries, seven of them in Africa. Several went to Bridge to Health, a Canadian charity that Dr. Cherniak founded six years ago; it works closely with Kihefo, a medical charity based in western Uganda.For now, the scanners are primarily used to check for pneumonia, which is a major killer of children in poor countries and is frequently misdiagnosed. But Dr. Cherniaks team has found other fascinating uses for the devices  which they deployed under conditions almost as stark and dusty as those found in battlefield medicine.Kihefo runs what might be described as a traveling medical circus. Each day at dawn, its roustabouts drive a truck loaded with collapsible tents into a different village and erect them on whatever flat ground they find  perhaps a patch of goat-gnawed grass between the school and the church.To improvise examination tables, they borrow the wooden school desks and church pews, pad them with yoga mats and screen them with thin purple curtains.An hour later, the Canadian-Ugandan brigade rolls in  vans full of doctors, nurses, dentists, chiropractors, gynecologists, ophthalmologists and pharmacists, accompanied by local clinical officers and medical students, all toting huge bags of equipment. (Yes, hockey bags  its a Canadian charity.)While the dental team fills cavities and the ophthalmologists check eyes, the medical team sees one patient after another, from newborns to nonagenarians.On a recent visit to this village, the doctors used their Butterflies not just to screen for pneumonia, but to scan other organs. Checking a large goiter on the neck of a 42-year-old woman, they learned that it was pressing on her windpipe, meaning she would soon need surgery, even though she had no breathing problems yet.They scanned the lungs of a frighteningly emaciated baby to see if she had tuberculosis. They scanned the swollen testicle of a 54-year-old man and determined that he probably had cancer rather than their first tentative diagnosis  fluid draining from worm-infested lymph glands.Scanning the abdomen of a child with a penis birth defect, they learned that his urine was backing up, threatening him with kidney damage  a problem that a simple operation could correct. They scanned a lump in the chest of a 96-year-old man and concluded that it was probably not cancerous because it lacked blood vessels. Particularly challenging was the case of a 51-year-old woman with a lump on her neck. In part because she described a long history of what sounded like tuberculosis, they initially suspected scrofula.(Scrofula  once called the Kings Evil because medieval monarchs claimed to cure it by touch  is caused by TB bacteria clumping under the skin. )I went to a healer who stabbed me with fire, the woman said, describing a traditional method for draining an abscess: heating a knife in a fire and plunging it into the lump. It hurt a lot and healed nothing, she said.Scanning the lump, Dr. Cherniak saw that it had veins, meaning it was not an abscess and appeared to be attached to a blood vessel.See it pulsing away? he said to his trainee as they looked at his phone. You dont want to go anywhere near that. If I did a biopsy, it could bleed a lot. Now I know not to muck around with it and get her to a surgeon.Some cases remained mysterious. A knotty lump in a 70-year-old womans thigh seemed to be neither a tumor, cyst, abscess nor fat deposit. Dr. Cherniaks best guess was that it was the broken-off tip of a stick she said she had been stabbed with decades earlier.Through a translator, he explained that he could remove it surgically, but the procedure would be painful and the wound might get infected.Its like a bullet you leave if its safer to not remove it, he said.She decided to live with it.Even more mystifying was a woman who appeared to be over 70 but whose belly was so swollen that she looked pregnant. Doctor after doctor tried scanning her; the gallons of fluid in her abdomen had shoved her organs far from their customary places. Surprisingly, her liver seemed normal  doctors initially had guessed the swelling resulted from alcoholic cirrhosis. But no one could find her spleen. What if its ALL spleen? Dr. Cherniak mused. Could it really get that big?Various theories  a blocked liver vein, lesions from a sand-fly parasite, a mucus-emitting tumor  were discussed. Finally, all agreed that she needed further scans that only a hospital could do.The Butterflys diagnostic potential is enormous, Kihefos founder, Dr. Geoffrey Anguyo, said enthusiastically: But the question is, how much training is adequate?Learning to interpret the fuzzy black-and-white images on a cellphone screen and recognize all the organs, blood vessels, valves and whatnot inside the body  and to do it well enough to spot tumors and other anomalies  is a skill that can take months to learn.The Gates Foundation, Dr. Rothberg said, is writing software intended to guide untrained users as they scan. For now, Bridge to Health is focusing on teaching Kihefos clinical officers, who get up to four years medical training but are not physicians, to diagnose pneumonia.Success will be achieved, Dr. Anguyo and Dr. Cherniak agreed, when the officers diagnoses agree with those of the ultrasound specialists in Toronto at least 80 percent of the time.Thats where another aspect of the Butterfly comes in handy: iPhones make it easy to upload scans to the internet.In Gordons case, a Canadian reviewer confirmed the diagnosis but said Mr. Muhumuza needed to improve his technique by holding the scanner at a sharper angle and setting it to project sound waves deeper. Five years ago, Bridge to Health and Kihefo jointly pioneered another imaginative use for ultrasound.Knowing how hard it is to convince rural women to visit doctors early in their pregnancies, they acquired some portable briefcase-sized scanners and then aired radio ads announcing where Kihefo would set up next the next morning. You will be able to see your unborn baby, they promised.Attendance at their antenatal clinics shot up sixfold, and women who had previously seen only traditional healers began coming in.That was important because doctors could offer many kinds of care. Problems that can kill a mother or baby can be detected and prevented early in pregnancy, including H.I.V., syphilis, vitamin deficiencies and high blood pressure.The success of that program was how we were able to get support from U.S.A.I.D., said Dr. Anguyo, referring to the United States Agency for International Development.U.S.A.I.D. was looking for unique ways to check women aged 15 to 30 for H.I.V., and we had a very good trap for catching those women, he said.Now, with American grants for the war on AIDS shrinking, Kihefo is hunting for new ways to raise money. One new project, Dr. Anguyo said, helps local farmers switch from raising chickens to raising rabbits. Rabbits eat grass, which costs nothing, so the profit margin is greater than for chickens, which need corn.Kihefo encourages its farmers to eat some rabbits for protein and sell the rest to pay their national health insurance premiums.Better pneumonia diagnosis can also slow the overprescription of antibiotics, which hastens the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.Of the 91 children with fevers and coughs the team scanned in a week, only one in the village  Gordon  had confirmed pneumonia.That, Dr. Cherniak surmised, was probably because modern vaccines against pneumonia-causing bacteria are working well.All the children got antibiotics anyway, because Ugandan national medical protocols require a prescription for every child with high fever and cough. Thats common in poor countries, where it is often impossible to get confirmatory X-rays. (Kihefos only X-ray machine, for example, is closed down because the charity cannot afford to build lead walls around it.)Eventually, if ultrasound gains acceptance, the national protocols should change. If a clinical officer can say, Its viral, you can go home, Dr. Cherniak said, you can decrease those wrong prescriptions.For Gordon, the prompt diagnosis worked out: a visit to the Kihefo clinic 24 hours after he started his antibiotics found him sitting up in bed, smiling and feeling much better.Donald G.

"I think I would be happy and successful in a business career that centers on dealing with people." His summer job at Mohican Adventures also influenced his college choice. "A couple of guys I worked with go there and told me the programs there are awesome, and I confirmed that in my studies of various college. Akron has an outstanding business program." Henleys favorite subjects at LHS were the biological sciences. "I really enjoyed Mr. David Sprengs Biology II class because of the outdoor work we did in it, like taxonomy," he said. "In fact, I have always enjoyed doing things outdoors." He also loves sports. At LHS, Henley has earned four letters in basketball and baseball, three in soccer, and one in football, and commented, "of the sports, I think I like basketball the best, even though I am not as good at it as baseball." Henley also grew up in a big family, as the fifth of six children of Chuck and Rita Henley of Loudonville. His eldest sister, Lauren Davis, 34, is a teacher in Columbus; Twila Soles, 33, who lives in Colorado and is a craft beer brewer; Will, 22, also in Columbus where he drives truck for Amazon; Liz, 20, who recently graduated from college at the Bradford School in Columbus; and James, 14, an eighth-grader. Asked if any individual had a major influence on his life, he immediately mentioned his older brother Will. "We were very close when we were younger, and he taught me to play, and enjoy, all sports," he said. At LHS, he cited social studies teacher Eric Stoner as the most influential. "I took a college level politics class from him, and learned a lot about politics and government, and in the process, he shared a lot of knowledge and experience about a lot of other subjects," Henley said. Last year, as a junior, he took four College Credit Plus courses, two math and two social studies, but this year he is sticking just with LHS classes. "Among them this year are calculus and physics, both pretty tough classes," he said. In addition to all the sports, Henley is a member of the high schools Leo Club and the National Honor Society. He was captain of the basketball team this year, and is a member of St. Peter Catholic Church.

Credit:APBut even after Thursday's release substantial portions of the report are likely to remain shielded from public view.Barr has said he will redact four specific categories of information from the version of the report he releases to the public.These categories are:Following the release of the redacted version of the report, Democrats will call on Barr to testify before a congressional hearing. They are also considering subpoenaing Mueller himself to appear to Congress to explain his findings.Matthew Knott is a journalist for The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age based in the United States.Copyright  2019Tiger Woods' improbable Masters victory will reward the few companies that stuck with him through his struggles, along with the ones that joined him when he was near the low point of his career.The 43-year-old won his fifth Masters title on Sunday by one stroke. It's his first major victory in over a decade and just his second PGA Tour victory in more than five years.Tiger Woods' victory at Augusta was lucrative for Nike. Credit:APIt's also a win for his sponsors. During the final-round telecast, when he made a late charge, he generated more than $US23.6 million in exposure for various corporate partners, according to sponsorship analytics firm Apex Marketing Group. Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing executive at Baker Street Advertising, cited Woods's ability to bring even casual fans to their televisions."He moves the needle like no other golfer does or ever has done," Dorfman said, comparing Woods' legendary status to that of Michael Jordan. "Nobody can do what he does and it's amazing he's been able to do it for as long as he has."Woods' return to the center of golf's biggest stage will probably drive added interest in pro golf for a while and generate even more attention for his corporate partners. It will also renew debate over whether a healthy Woods can regain the dominance of his early career, when he single-handedly boosted golf's status around the world.Woods now has 15 major titles, three shy of Jack Nicklaus' record 18.In the moments after Woods' final putt on Sunday, longtime sponsor Nike released a video congratulating him on the feat, and highlighting his push to pass Nicklaus. The video uses audio from a 3-year-old Woods listing his golf aspirations."To think a 43-year-old who has experienced every high and every low, and has just won his 15th major, is chasing the same dream as a 3-year-old," the video says.No company is more closely associated with Woods than Nike, which signed him when he turned pro back in 1996 and built its golf business around his stardom. Woods was once making $US30 million a year from Nike, according to Forbes, but in 2016 the company announced it would stop making golf clubs, balls and bags. Nike is still Woods's apparel partner - the red Nike shirt he wore on Sunday is a familiar sight to most fans - but over the past few years Woods has had to look elsewhere for ball and club partners.Nike shares rose as much as 1.2 per cent to $US87.24 in New York trading Monday. The effect extended to golf brands unconnected to Woods: Callaway Golf gained as much as 4.1 per cent, while Titleist parent Acushnet Holdings Corp. was up as much as 4.2 per cent.During a decade when Woods's life was marred by marital trouble, substance abuse, multiple surgeries and inconsistent play, many of the other brands associated with the former star either dropped him outright or failed to renew their partnerships. They included AT&T, Gillette, Buick and watchmaker Tag Heuer.In their place is a new stable of partners. Monster Energy has been branding Woods's bag since 2016. TaylorMade is now his club sponsor; Bridgestone makes his golf balls. There are also smaller deals with Hero MotoCorp, an Indian motorcycle maker, and Kowa, a Japanese pharmaceutical company. Several of them sought to capitalise on the moment, with Monster Energy musing what a tiger's favored color might be.Tiger Woods was once making $US30 million a year from Nike, according to Forbes, but that number has dwindled in recent years.Credit:APWoods carried 13 TaylorMade clubs on Sunday, according to Chief Executive Officer David Abeles. While the Masters win is great for the golf business overall, and it's good for sales when fans see Woods win tournaments using TaylorMade clubs, Woods has helped the privately owned brand in another major way."He's been heavily involved in our research and development functions, and heavily involved in our product creation," Abeles said. "He has one of the most incredible perspectives on product technology of any athlete we've ever worked with."Abeles, who declined to provide financial details of the agreement with Woods, said TaylorMade has already seen a boost in interest following the Masters. Phone volume on Monday morning was three times heavier than it was last week, and website traffic after the Masters was double what it was after the tournament last year.During Sunday's final round telecast on CBS, Woods's prominent placement was a boon to many of those brands. Nike saw $US22.5 million in exposure, according to Apex. Monster received $US960,000, while Bridgestone saw $US134,000. Those numbers will increase as highlights and print media push images of Woods's win across the globe. They'll also jump at later tournaments that receive a Woods boost in viewership and attention.At the height of his career, Woods was making $US110 million per year as the world's highest paid athlete, including that $US30 million from Nike, according to Forbes. Last year the magazine reported his earnings as $US43.3 million.For now, Woods sounded bewildered at his resurrection to top-dog status."I'm kind of at a loss for words," Woods said after the win. "It's overwhelming because of what has transpired."BloombergCopyright  2019APThe Minnesota Twins host the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday night.

Ad Choices  One of the most underutilized and misused Superstar on the current roster has to be Shinsuke Nakamura. Although, a former US Champion and winner of the Royal Rumble, it would be safe to say that Nakamura has not been used to his full potential in WWE.There had been a lot of speculation regarding Nakamura's future in the WWE, as it was alleged that The Rockstar is not happy with his state in WWE and may not re-sign his contract when it is up.However, as per recent reports, the truth seems entirely different.Shinsuke Nakamura started his pro-wrestling career in 2002 in Japan. He rose through the ranks in Japan and finally captured the coveted IWGP World Championship in NJPW. He also held various other championships like the IWGP Intercontinental Championship and IWGP Tag Team Championships during his stay in NJPW.The Artist made his debut in WWE as part of NXT in 2016, and was able to capture the NXT Championship as well.However, his run on the main roster has been sub-par, and even though he has had a series of great matches, the 39-year-old has failed to break through.Also Read: When former WWE Champion physically attacked Vince McMahon on a flightWhile there was speculation that Nakamura may be planning to jump ship and join AEW, those rumors may not hold any truth.Dave Meltzer responded to a fan asking if Shinsuke was staying with WWE or leaving, and Meltzer stated that he is staying.Staying https://t.co/RRFw24I3T8Shinsuke Nakamura is currently paired with Rusev on SmackDown and the two have become an important part of the Tag Team division.Do you think it is wise for Nakamura to continue with WWE?Also Read: WWE adds a major stipulation in The Undertaker's new contractBy Tim Collins For Mailonline  Published: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 15:00 EDT, 15 April 2019   4View  commentsMore than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland.An international research team traced more than ten generations in the same grave.They said their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe.More than ten generations of the same family were buried in giant Stone Age tombs, reveals a new study.Scientists analysed human remains from tombs in Scotland, Ireland and on the Swedish island of Gotland. This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Swedensequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe.The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland.The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmstrm, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths.Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe. The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea (pictured) is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles. A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia.These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and thelevel of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe.Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women.Cook, who born in1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found.She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985.Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine.Prudhomme, who was born in1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed.The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered.Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine.Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved.Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 15:43 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:24 EDT, 15 April 2019   724View  commentsThe world stood helpless as Notre Dame burned on Monday and hundreds of French fire fighters worked to put out the blaze.As they battled the flames, world leaders and celebrities took to social media in shock to share their sadness and disbelief.They likened the gut-wrenching images and videos of the cathedral's crumbling spire to like watching 'someone you love die'.United in their sadness, here are some of their reactions.Fire fighters continue to battle the flames at the Notre Dame in Paris, hours after a fire broke outPublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Jessica Green and Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline and David Churchill and Peter Allen In Paris For The Daily Mail  Published: 15:34 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 01:11 EDT, 16 April 2019   1kView  commentsThe French Interior Ministry said 400 firefighters were mobilised to help tackle the blaze that engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday.And while hundreds of comments flooded the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters, many questions were raised as to how the fire was dealt with.Did fire crews react quickly enough?The Paris fire chief last night paid tribute to his crews, saying they had saved the cathedral from total destruction.Commander Jean-Claude Gallet said a major accomplishment of hundreds of firefighters was stopping the flames from spreading to the north tower belfry.The ministry said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blazeHe said two-thirds of Notre Dame's roofing 'has been ravaged' and one firefighter was injured. Fire crews will keep working overnight to cool down the structure, Mr Gallet added.However, there was criticism that the fire service had not responded quickly enough  and didn't seem to have the right equipment to tackle such a large blaze.Flames appeared to be raging inside the cathedral for a long time before water jets capable of stopping them were mobilised.Were the fire crews well-equipped enough to deal with the flames?Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a height. Last night, the French interior ministry tried to defend the response  insisting that 400 firemen had been deployed.The ministry suggested that aircraft were not used because it was feared that the weight of water falling at such a height could cause large parts of the cathedral to collapse.Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a heightIn an online statement it said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze.However, pictures appeared to show that this was the only one of its kind and residents questioned why more pressure hoses and cherry-picker cranes were not on site to be able to douse the flames from above as they took hold of the scaffolding and the roof near to the spire.As the blaze raged, the Paris authorities insisted that getting fire teams to the top of the building 'was almost impossible'.'It's much too high up, and the only access is stone and spiral staircases,' said an emergency services source. 'This means that the fire has been able to spread across the roof.'Jets of water are seen desperately trying to extinguish the flames engulfing Notre DameLocal resident Michel Dupont said those living around the cathedral were upset more equipment was not on site to spray water at the flames high up. 'A lot of us are asking questions about the authorities' response,' he said.Liz Boeder, another Parisian, said 'we need California firefighters', in reference to the water-carrying aircraft used to tackle the forest fires in the US last year. Others who watched the blaze unfold on live TV also raised questions.Kent Ardleb said: 'What a tragedy. Notre Dame cathedral is lost. Where is the damn fire brigade?'Another posted: 'How come there aren't any fire fighters or water jets to be seen on any photos!?'Dave Pasin said: 'It seems there are no firefighters to be seen, no water, nothing?'The French Interior Ministry has mobilised 400 firefighters to help tackle the inferno that has been burning for hoursWhy did the fire brigade not drop water on the Notre Dame Cathedral?Authorities have revealed they were unable to drop water on the landmark to tame the blaze for fear it would ruin what was left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.French news site Le Monde, explained: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.Firefighters look at the fire at the landmark Notre Dame Cathedral in central Paris as they cross a bridge over the Seine river'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.'What caused the blaze to spread so quickly?The roof structure is made entirely in timber, with each beam being made from a single oak tree in a tight lattice  which may be the key to understanding last night's disaster. In all, 5,000 oaks were used in making it.Using innovative architectural techniques to assert France's growing status as a European power, its soaring vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses and doors surmounted by a row of figures of Old Testament kings were an expression of royal grandeur.The building is longer than a football pitch at 427ft, with its largely wooden spire  which collapsed on Monday  once soaring 300ft into the Parisian sky. The sheer amount of wood and its grand scale both worked against it when the blaze took hold.A picture taken less than a month ago shows a scaffold during the restoration of Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, in Paris'It makes sense that it would be incredibly flammable,' explained Notre Dame contributor Daniel Christian on the website for the landmark.The structure's aging wooden frame has long been a topic of concern, and a $6.8million renovation project was underway to address some of the many issues at the historic building.But as the fire 'started near the spire, where the scaffolding is,' it has been suggested that the renovation work sparked the flames.Officials have not yet determined if this was the case.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Laura Collins, Chief Investigative Reporter For Dailymail.com  Published: 15:22 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 16:16 EDT, 15 April 2019   2View  commentsA wealthy New York investment advisor is being sued for more than $5million by his ex-girlfriend who claims he assaulted and humiliated her on a trip to Jamaica earlier this year, in a violent outburst that has left her struggling with PTSD.Yale educated Matthew Ram Shannon Lee, 45, is co-founder and partner of the Manhattan based investment advisor firm, Seven Bridges Advisors, which currently manages a staggering $5billion worth of assets.Lee met Jenna Bickelmann, 33, a buyer for fashion store, Milly, through The League an exclusive dating app with membership plans costing up to $999 a month.The app - whose name is a nod to Ivy League - bills itself as a 'dating and social networking community' whose members share the common thread of 'ambition and a drive to succeed.'Jenna Bickelmann, 33, is suing Matthew Ram Shannon Lee, 45, for $5million over claims he physically and emotionally abused her during their months-long relationship, leaving her with PTSDLee is co-founder and partner of the Manhattan based investment advisor firm, Seven Bridges Advisors, which currently manages $5billion worth of assetsAccording to court documents obtained by DailyMail.com the couple met in person in September 2018.Three months later, on December 29, Lee invited Bickelmann to join him on a business trip to Charleston, South Carolina where he was attending conferences at the elite, invite-only Renaissance Weekend.The weekend was one of several organized across the country each year by an organization once co-chaired by Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford.The weekends began almost forty years ago as a four-day house party thrown by former US Ambassador Phil Lader and his wife at their home in Hilton Head Island.Exclusive and discrete they have been attended by Supreme Court Justices, Senators, Members of Congress and Governors, business leaders, astronauts, Olympic athletes, and Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Nobel prizewinners.Lee covered all of Bicklemann's expenses including airfares so she could join him on the trip that spanned New Year's Eve.Guests were encouraged to enjoy Charleston's, 'cocoon of gentility.'That 'gentility' didn't even make it past New Year's Day for Bickelmann and Lee who, she claims, got into 'a heated verbal argument' when she wanted to dine somewhere other than the restaurant he had booked.Despite this, she agreed to join him on a trip to Jamaica later that month. The couple flew out on January 23 and stayed at The Lagoons, a gated community in Montego Bay where a two-bedroom villa can cost up to $15,000 a week.Bickelmann met Lee through exclusive dating app The League in fall 2018 and the couple went on two trips together to South Carolina in December and Jamaica in January 2019On the Jamaica trip, Lee 'violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand,' according to court documents seen by DailyMail.com. Lee is pictured second from the left at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) conference in 2016As before, Lee paid for everything and, as before, things quickly descended into acrimony.On January 25, two days after their arrival, Bicklemann claims, that Lee committed the first of two assaults against her after they got into an argument in a taxicab.Bickelmann, who works as a buyer for fashion store Milly, is suing for damages to recover from 'personal injuries, emotional distress, assault and battery'According to her lawsuit, 'Lee grabbed [her] face with his hand, shoved her backwards away from him into the seat of the taxi cab and called [her] 'a f***ing b****.'Shocked, Bickelmann called a male friend who advised her that Lee's behavior was 'abnormal and that she should leave Jamaica as soon as she could for her own safety.'She told Lee that she wanted to return to New York and he agreed to change her departure flight from January 27 to 26 while he stayed on.Her court filing states that Lee had planned a yacht outing at 1pm on the day of her departure and therefore told her to leave the villa and head to the airport at 12.30pm.When she said she did not want to make the short trip - some fifteen minutes drive - so early as her flight was not until 3.30pm the couple got into an argument over the best way to lock up the villa.Lee didn't want to be late but nor did he want to leave the keys with Bickelmann.According to Bickelmann the verbal argument turned violent when she attempted to leave the patio where they had been arguing and go back inside.She claimed, 'In the midst of removing herself from this argument with [Lee] who was continuously yelling at her in a degrading manner and cursing at her, [Lee] violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand.'The hit was so unexpected and violent, she claims, she lost her balance and fell onto a nearby patio chair.Bickelmann says in the lawsuit that Lee knew she had previously been in an abusive relationship and suffered from TMJ which was made worse by his alleged abuseAfter regaining her balance, her complaint continued, 'she ran to another chairnow in fear of being hit a second time she began to cry and was in disbelief he struck her.'Bickelmann claimed her face 'began to swell and become very red,' and that she repeatedly stated, 'Ram you just hit me!'Her screams and their shouting were loud enough for a concerned neighbor to call The Lagoons Security who witnessed Lee pull the weeping Bickelmann back into the villa and shut the sliding glass doors.The alleged assault was made all the worse, Bickelmann has claimed, by the fact that Lee knew her to be a victim of domestic violence and that she suffered from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder causing her severe pain in her jaw.She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the alleged assault.DailyMail.com has requested comment from both Lee and Bicklemann's attorney, but have not heard back.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy William Cole For Mailonline  Published: 15:14 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 02:18 EDT, 16 April 2019   54View  commentsThe ruined former-home of a real-life 'Wicker Man' and a legendary guitarist has been put for sale -

Trump tweeted.Trump also tweeted congratulations to the golfing legend over the weekend.This is Woods' fifth green jacket, and his win on Sunday is already being lauded as one of the greatest sports comebacks of all time.President Trump will be awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Tiger Woods because of his success and comeback in sports and lifeWoods earned his fifth green jacket Sunday after it seemed his career was over following several physical obstacles and person issuesThe Medal of Freedom is an award bestowed by the President of the United States that recognizes 'an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors'It was established in 1945 to honor civilian service during World War II.Other sports icons who have received the award include Michael Jordan, Joe DiMaggio, Babe Ruth, Yogi Berra, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.In the past few years, it seemed as though Woods' career was over as he faced a series of personal problems and chronic back pain. He had a spinal fusion surgery in 2017.That same year, he faced charges for driving under the influence.Woods' personal life, and career, had already been on the decline before the back surgery and DUI charge when years before his ongoing cheating was brought to light.Woods won the Gene Serazen Cup in 2013 at the Cadillac Championship golf tournament at Trump National Dural in Florida. Trump is an avid golfer and often spends his free time on the courseWoods' last Masters win before Sunday was in 2005, 14 years agoWoods met his now-former wifeElin Nordegren in 2001, and they had two children.In 2009 the chronic cheating went public when the National Enquirer published a story outlining his relationship with Rachel Uchitel, a New York City nightclub hostess.Woods also had a relationship with cocktail waitress Jaimee Grubbs.Other than his two mistresses, Woods also reportedly had unprotected sex with porn starts.Following the scandals Nike, Gatorade and other sponsors of Woods lost billions of dollars collectively, and some dropped him completely.At the time, Woods released a statement saying he was 'taking an indefinite leave from golf to work on saving his marriage,' and wanted to focus 'on being a better husband, father, and person.'Woods had a few good seasons upon returning to golf after news of the affairs simmered, but never had another big win until this weekend.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Jessica Green and Isabella Nikolic For Mailonline and David Churchill and Peter Allen In Paris For The Daily Mail  Published: 15:34 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 01:11 EDT, 16 April 2019   1kView  commentsThe French Interior Ministry said 400 firefighters were mobilised to help tackle the blaze that engulfed the Notre Dame Cathedral on Monday.And while hundreds of comments flooded the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters, many questions were raised as to how the fire was dealt with.Did fire crews react quickly enough?The Paris fire chief last night paid tribute to his crews, saying they had saved the cathedral from total destruction.Commander Jean-Claude Gallet said a major accomplishment of hundreds of firefighters was stopping the flames from spreading to the north tower belfry.The ministry said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blazeHe said two-thirds of Notre Dame's roofing 'has been ravaged' and one firefighter was injured. Fire crews will keep working overnight to cool down the structure, Mr Gallet added.However, there was criticism that the fire service had not responded quickly enough  and didn't seem to have the right equipment to tackle such a large blaze.Flames appeared to be raging inside the cathedral for a long time before water jets capable of stopping them were mobilised.Were the fire crews well-equipped enough to deal with the flames?Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a height. Last night, the French interior ministry tried to defend the response  insisting that 400 firemen had been deployed.The ministry suggested that aircraft were not used because it was feared that the weight of water falling at such a height could cause large parts of the cathedral to collapse.Many observers, watching the tragedy unfold on TV, asked whether the fire teams had been well-equipped enough to deal with flames at such a heightIn an online statement it said that an 'exceptional device' had been deployed to tackle the fire, with a crane lifting a fireman to tackle the blaze.However, pictures appeared to show that this was the only one of its kind and residents questioned why more pressure hoses and cherry-picker cranes were not on site to be able to douse the flames from above as they took hold of the scaffolding and the roof near to the spire.As the blaze raged, the Paris authorities insisted that getting fire teams to the top of the building 'was almost impossible'.'It's much too high up, and the only access is stone and spiral staircases,' said an emergency services source. 'This means that the fire has been able to spread across the roof.'Jets of water are seen desperately trying to extinguish the flames engulfing Notre DameLocal resident Michel Dupont said those living around the cathedral were upset more equipment was not on site to spray water at the flames high up. 'A lot of us are asking questions about the authorities' response,' he said.Liz Boeder, another Parisian, said 'we need California firefighters', in reference to the water-carrying aircraft used to tackle the forest fires in the US last year. Others who watched the blaze unfold on live TV also raised questions.Kent Ardleb said: 'What a tragedy. Notre Dame cathedral is lost. Where is the damn fire brigade?'Another posted: 'How come there aren't any fire fighters or water jets to be seen on any photos!?'Dave Pasin said: 'It seems there are no firefighters to be seen, no water, nothing?'The French Interior Ministry has mobilised 400 firefighters to help tackle the inferno that has been burning for hoursWhy did the fire brigade not drop water on the Notre Dame Cathedral?Authorities have revealed they were unable to drop water on the landmark to tame the blaze for fear it would ruin what was left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.French news site Le Monde, explained: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.Firefighters look at the fire at the landmark Notre Dame Cathedral in central Paris as they cross a bridge over the Seine river'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.'What caused the blaze to spread so quickly?The roof structure is made entirely in timber, with each beam being made from a single oak tree in a tight lattice  which may be the key to understanding last night's disaster. In all, 5,000 oaks were used in making it.Using innovative architectural techniques to assert France's growing status as a European power, its soaring vaulted ceilings, flying buttresses and doors surmounted by a row of figures of Old Testament kings were an expression of royal grandeur.The building is longer than a football pitch at 427ft, with its largely wooden spire  which collapsed on Monday  once soaring 300ft into the Parisian sky. The sheer amount of wood and its grand scale both worked against it when the blaze took hold.A picture taken less than a month ago shows a scaffold during the restoration of Notre Dame de Paris cathedral, in Paris'It makes sense that it would be incredibly flammable,' explained Notre Dame contributor Daniel Christian on the website for the landmark.The structure's aging wooden frame has long been a topic of concern, and a $6.8million renovation project was underway to address some of the many issues at the historic building.But as the fire 'started near the spire, where the scaffolding is,' it has been suggested that the renovation work sparked the flames.Officials have not yet determined if this was the case.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.com  Published: 14:48 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 08:19 EDT, 16 April 2019   1View  commentsShots were reportedly fired in an alleged drive-by shooting at California rapper YG's Coachella after-party following his earlier performance.The Big Bank rapper performed on the Coachella stage on Sunday night where he paid tribute to his close friend LA rapper Nipsey Hussle who was murdered two weeks ago.

Thirty bodies have been found in the Killing Fields since the 1970s.Advances in forensic technology allowed detectives to finally identity the skeletal remains of the latest two victims who, up until this week, had only been known as Jane Doe and Janet Doe.Cook and Prudhomme were identified in part due to DNA phenotyping, which can predict physical appearance and provide renderings of the victims.Authorities also used genetic genealogy, which is what detectives used to help catch the infamous Golden State serial killer.It is the use of new DNA technology testing combined with traditional genealogical methods to establish the relationship between an individual and their ancestors who have voluntarily uploaded their DNA to public genealogy databases.Audrey Lee Cook (pictured left in a rendering police released last year) was believed to have been 30 years old when she diedDonna Prudhomme (pictured left) in a rendering police released last year following DNA phenotyping) is believed to have been 34 when she was killedDetectives investigating the two cold case murders started building family trees in April last year based on the genetic genealogy.They were able to narrow down potential family members who provided DNA that investigators then positively linked to the murdered women.Cook, who born in1955, was believed to have been 30 years old when she died. Authorities said she may have died anywhere from six weeks to six months before her body was found.She was believed to have been living in the Houston area at the time and lost contact with her family in December 1985.Associates reported that she possibly sold and used cocaine.Prudhomme, who was born in1957, was believed to be 34 when she was killed.The identification of their bodies comes decades after their grisly remains were discovered in the oil field along Calder Road in League City just outside HoustonPolice believe she had been dead six weeks when her body was discovered.Authorities have suggested she died from apparent injuries to her upper spine.Prudhomme was last known to have lived in Nassau Bay, Texas in the same year that she was killed.Detectives believe that Prudhomme frequented several of the local bars in the area near where she lived.Despite the two women finally being identified, police said their murder cases still remain unsolved.Cook and Prudhomme were never officially reported missing by their families.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Associated Press and Dailymail.com Reporters  Published: 01:51 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:57 EDT, 15 April 2019   3View  commentsA judge has decided that the white man suspected in the burning of three African American churches in Louisiana will remain in jail as state prosecutors added new charges declaring the arsons a hate crime.Holden Matthews, 21, the son of a sheriff's deputy, entered his not guilty plea via video conference from Louisiana's St. Landry Parish jail Monday morning. The judge denied bond and set a September trial date.Matthews was arrested April 10 in connection with the arson attacks at three historically-black churches over a 10-day period in Opelousas, Louisiana.A judge denied Holden Matthews, 21, bail after he pleaded not guilty to charges against him via video conference Monday. He is suspected in the burnings of three black churches in Louisiana, which authorities think could be a hate crimeMt. Pleasant Baptist Church, in Opelousas, Louisiana, is one of the three historic black churches Matthews is suspected of setting on fire in early AprilProtesters from Louisiana's St. Landry Parish branch of the NAACP were seen holding signs outside the courthouse during Matthews' bond hearing Monday In denying Matthews bail, state District Judge James Doherty sided with law enforcement officials who said they worried Matthews would try to flee the area or set more fires.'We felt that he was an immediate risk to public safety,' said Louisiana Fire Marshal Butch Browning. 'In my mind, I felt another fire was imminent.'Testifying in court, Browning outlined a litany of evidence, including some new details of the investigation, that he said tied Matthews to the torching of the three black churches over 10 days.The fire marshal described cellphone records placing Matthews at the fire locations, and he said images on the phone showed all three churches burning before law enforcement arrived and showed Matthews 'claiming responsibility' for the fires.The judge denied Matthews' bond and set a September trial date. In addition to his original charges ofarson of a religious building, prosecutors added charges ofviolating Louisiana's hate crime law MondayLouisiana State Fire Marshal Butch Browning appeared in court Monday, telling the judge that he felt that Matthews would either flee or start another fire if he received a bondMatthews, who had no previous criminal record, was arrested Wednesday on three charges of arson of a religious building.Prosecutors filed documents Monday adding three more charges, accusing Matthews of violating Louisiana's hate crime law, confirming that they believe the fires were racially motivated, a link authorities had previously stopped short of making.Browning said federal officials also are considering filing additional federal hate crime and arson charges against Matthews.Matthews, shackled and wearing an orange prison jumpsuit, never spoke to the court during the hearing, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter the not guilty plea for him.His parents watched their son's appearance on video conference from the courtroom, his dad repeatedly wringing his hands and, at one point, leaving the room in tears.The fires, all started with gasoline, occurred in and around Opelousas, about 60 miles west of Louisiana's capital city of Baton Rouge.Authorities said Matthews had ties to 'black metal' - an extreme subgenre of heavy metal that has an association with church burnings in other parts of the worldMatthews is described on his Facebook page as the lead singer for a heavy metal band called Vodka Vultures and showed an interest in 'black metal' music, some of which has been linked to fires at Christian churches in Norway in the 1990sMount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas was the last of the three churches to be burned down on April 4Firefighters and fire investigators respond to a fire at Mt. Pleasant Baptist Church on April 4Emergency crews are seen outside the Greater Union Baptist Church in Opelousas, which was also burned downMatthews' arrest came a little more than two weeks after the first blaze at the St. Mary Baptist Church on March 26 in Port Barre, a town just outside of Opelousas. Days later, the Greater Union Baptist Church and Mount Pleasant Baptist Church in Opelousas were burned. Each was more than 100 years old.The churches were empty at the time, and no one was injured. But at one location, two occupants of a nearby home had to evacuate when the siding on the home started to catch fire from the church.The fires set the community on edge. Gov. John Bel Edwards said the church burnings were a reminder 'of a very dark past of intimidation and fear.'Matthews' attorney Quincy Cawthorne questioned some of the evidence cited by Browning and said Matthews didn't have the financial means to be a flight risk. He also objected to suggestions that the house near one of the churches was intentionally set on fire, putting the residents' lives in danger.A pretrial hearing in the case was set for July 17, with jury selection scheduled to begin September 10.Prosecutors, through Browning's testimony, gave more insight into the evidence that law enforcement used to build their case against Matthews.Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms Bureau investigators work the crime scene of the burnt ruins of the Mount Pleasant Baptist Church the week after the fire was setCharred remains of pews were among the rubble left after one of the churches burned downThe exterior of one of the churches Matthews is accused of having set on fire in LouisianaThe fire marshal said a receipt shows Matthews bought a gas can and a package of oil rags similar to those found at the site of the fires. A lighter and the package of oil rags, missing some of its contents, were found in Matthews' truck, Browning said. He said Matthews documented the fire on his cellphone, while video surveillance in the area around the churches showed a truck similar to the one Matthews drives. Matthews had copies of news reports about the fires on his phone as well, Browning said.'He actually superimposed himself on those news reports, claiming responsibility for these fires,' Browning said.In addition, Browning said video on Matthews' phone showed a conversation with a friend before the fires in which he talked about burning churches and using gasoline to do it. The fire marshal said Matthews posted on Facebook about and showed interest in a movie called 'Lords of Chaos,' which Browning said is a recent Norwegian film that involved church burnings.Matthews seen posing with a guitar in front of a spray-painted 'black metal' signMatthew was known to post pictures of alters to Norse gods on his Facebook pageThe alters featured bits and pieces of bones as well as things meant to symbolize the godsMatthews also posted this image of a gun and a knife which he claimed to carry aroundMatthews had shown interest in 'black metal,' an extreme subgenre of heavy metal, Browning said. The music has been linked, in some instances, to fires at Christian churches in Norway in the 1990s.'The evidence we have was unequivocal,' Browning said. Later he added: 'He has clearly demonstrated the characteristics of a pathological fire setter.'Matthews' Facebook page describes him as the lead singer for a heavy metal band called Vodka Vultures.A Facebook page that appeared to belong to Matthews showed him with the words 'black metal' spray painted on a wall behind him. He also posted a comment on a movie's portrayal of black metal musician Varg Vikernes, a far-right figure convicted of manslaughter and arson at three churches in Norway.Black metal lyrics often espouse satanism and paganism, and a few bands feature neo-Nazi beliefs.The three churches destroyed by the fires have mostly black Baptist congregations, raising authorities' suspicion that the fires may be racially motivated hate crimes.The NAACP believed the fires were racially motivated given that they took place in historically black areas and called for the acts to be labeled as 'domestic terrorism'.'We must not turn a blind eye to any incident where people are targeted because of the color of their skin or their faith,' the group said in a statement April 8.'The spike in church burnings in Southern states is a reflection of the emboldened racial rhetoric and tension spreading across the country. But this is nothing new.'Just days prior to his arrest in connection with the church fires, Matthews was said to have turned to Facebook to express his anger about Baptists 'brainwashing' people, CNN reported.Matthews, apparently using the screen name 'Noctis Matthews' responded to a Facebook post about 'afrikan spirituality,' by writing that he could not 'stand all these baptists around here, bunch of brainwashed people trying to find happiness in a religion that was forced on their ancestors just as it was on mine.'He also went on to write that he wished 'more blacks [sic] people would look into ancient beliefs of pre Christian Africa.'Matthews was also said to have posted images of weapons and alters made to Norse gods on his personal Facebook, which included bits and pieces of animal bones, a fake human skull and other odds and ends.Matthews' father, Deputy Roy Matthews, was said to have been in the courtroom when his son pleaded not guilty and was seen wringing his hands and leaving the room in tears, CBS News reported.Roy Matthews, who was not aware of his son's actions, was said to have 'broke down' when he was called into the sheriff's office and told about the allegations against his son. He then helped facilitate his son's arrest.

The couple flew out on January 23 and stayed at The Lagoons, a gated community in Montego Bay where a two-bedroom villa can cost up to $15,000 a week.Bickelmann met Lee through exclusive dating app The League in fall 2018 and the couple went on two trips together to South Carolina in December and Jamaica in January 2019On the Jamaica trip, Lee 'violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand,' according to court documents seen by DailyMail.com. Lee is pictured second from the left at the New York Society of Security Analysts (NYSSA) conference in 2016As before, Lee paid for everything and, as before, things quickly descended into acrimony.On January 25, two days after their arrival, Bicklemann claims, that Lee committed the first of two assaults against her after they got into an argument in a taxicab.Bickelmann, who works as a buyer for fashion store Milly, is suing for damages to recover from 'personal injuries, emotional distress, assault and battery'According to her lawsuit, 'Lee grabbed [her] face with his hand, shoved her backwards away from him into the seat of the taxi cab and called [her] 'a f***ing b****.'Shocked, Bickelmann called a male friend who advised her that Lee's behavior was 'abnormal and that she should leave Jamaica as soon as she could for her own safety.'She told Lee that she wanted to return to New York and he agreed to change her departure flight from January 27 to 26 while he stayed on.Her court filing states that Lee had planned a yacht outing at 1pm on the day of her departure and therefore told her to leave the villa and head to the airport at 12.30pm.When she said she did not want to make the short trip - some fifteen minutes drive - so early as her flight was not until 3.30pm the couple got into an argument over the best way to lock up the villa.Lee didn't want to be late but nor did he want to leave the keys with Bickelmann.According to Bickelmann the verbal argument turned violent when she attempted to leave the patio where they had been arguing and go back inside.She claimed, 'In the midst of removing herself from this argument with [Lee] who was continuously yelling at her in a degrading manner and cursing at her, [Lee] violently struck [her] on the right side of her face with the back of his right hand.'The hit was so unexpected and violent, she claims, she lost her balance and fell onto a nearby patio chair.Bickelmann says in the lawsuit that Lee knew she had previously been in an abusive relationship and suffered from TMJ which was made worse by his alleged abuseAfter regaining her balance, her complaint continued, 'she ran to another chairnow in fear of being hit a second time she began to cry and was in disbelief he struck her.'Bickelmann claimed her face 'began to swell and become very red,' and that she repeatedly stated, 'Ram you just hit me!'Her screams and their shouting were loud enough for a concerned neighbor to call The Lagoons Security who witnessed Lee pull the weeping Bickelmann back into the villa and shut the sliding glass doors.The alleged assault was made all the worse, Bickelmann has claimed, by the fact that Lee knew her to be a victim of domestic violence and that she suffered from Temporomandibular Joint Disorder causing her severe pain in her jaw.She has also been diagnosed as suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of the alleged assault.DailyMail.com has requested comment from both Lee and Bicklemann's attorney, but have not heard back.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Alisha Buaya For Mailonline  Published: 15:27 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 04:40 EDT, 16 April 2019  View  commentsShe is not shy about flaunting her curvy physique in saucy outfits.But on Monday, Chloe Ferry covered up after landing back in Newcastle after a weekend away in Belfast with boyfriend Sam Gowland.The 23-year-old reality star looked cosy in an over-sized white jumper, matched with grey tights and white sneakers walking outside the airport.Looking cosy: Chloe Ferry covered up in an over-sized white jumper after landing back in Newcastle after a weekend away in Belfast with boyfriend Sam GowlandShe toted a couple of shopping bags and her pink suitcase with 'Chloe' emblazoned across the front.Alongside the Geordie Shore stunner was her beau Sam who also looked warm in his puffer jacket and black ensemble matched with trainers.He also brought along with him his suitcase, personalised with his initials SG.As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrire.Back home: The 23-year-old looked cosy alongside her beau Sam who also looked warm in his puffer jacket and black ensemble matched with trainers as they walked through the car parkJust peachy: As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrireJust peachy: As Chloe waited for their car to come around, she waited with her hand on her slender waist showing off her pert derrireTheir weekend away comes after Chloe came under fire from body confidence advocate Jameela Jamil for promoting weight loss products, a move that has resulted in her receiving death threats.The reality TV star was slammed for sharing a post about V24 'gummies' -

This image shows a megalithic site in the UKResearchers led by Uppsala University in Swedensequenced and analysed the genomes from the human remains of 24 individuals from five megalithic burial sites in northern and western Europe.The team collected human remains of 24 individuals from megaliths in Scotland, Ireland and the Baltic island of Gotland.The remains were radiocarbon-dated to between 3,800 and 2,600 BC. DNA was extracted from bones and teeth for genome sequencing.The researchers compared the genomic data to the genetic variation of Stone Age groups and individuals from other parts of Europe.The individuals in the megaliths were closely related to Neolithic farmers in northern and western Europe, and also to some groups in Iberia, but less related to farmer groups in central Europe.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles.Study co-first author Dr Helena Malmstrm, an archaeogeneticist ar Uppsala University, said: 'We found paternal continuity through time, including the same Y-chromosome haplotypes reoccurring over and over again.'However, female kindred members were not excluded from the megalith burials as three of the six kinship relationships in these megaliths involved females.'She said the genetic data show close kin relationships among the individuals buried within the megaliths.Experts say their findings suggest that that megaliths were graves for kindred groups in Stone Age north western Europe. The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea (pictured) is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The team found an 'over-representation' of males compared to females in the megalith tombs on the British Isles. A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and Tomb 1 at Primrose Grange (pictured)The Neolithic Revolution was the world's first verifiable revolution in agriculture.It began in Britain between about 5000 BC and 4500 BC but spread across Europe from origins in Syria and Iraq between about 11000 BC and 9000 BC.The period saw the widespread transition of many disparate human cultures from nomadic hunting and gathering practices to ones of farming and building small settlements.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later added to during the early Bronze AgeThe revolution was responsible for turning small groups of travellers into settled communities who built villages and towns.Some cultures used irrigation and made forest clearings to better their farming techniques.Others stored food for times of hunger, and farming eventually created different roles and divisions of labour in societies as well as trading economies.In the UK, the period was triggered by a huge migration or folk-movement from across the Channel.The Neolithic Revolution saw humans in Britain move from groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled communities. Some of the earliest monuments in Britain are Neolithic structures, including Silbury Hill in Wiltshire (pictured)Today, prehistoric monuments in the UK span from the time of the Neolithic farmers to the invasion of the Romans in AD 43.Many of them are looked after by English Heritage and range from standing stones to massive stone circles, and from burial mounds to hillforts.Stonehenge, the most famous prehistoric structure in Europe, possibly the world, was built by Neolithic people, and later finished during the Bronze Age.Neolithic structures were typically used for ceremonies, religious feasts and as centres for trade and social gatherings.Agriculture spread with migrants from the Fertile Crescent into Europe around 9,000 BC, reaching north western Europe by 4,000 BC.Starting around 4,500 BC, a new phenomenon of constructing megalithic monuments, particularly for funerary practices, emerged along the Atlantic.The constructions have been a mystery to the scientific community, and the origin and social structure of the groups that built them has remained largely unknown.A likely parent-offspring relation was discovered for individuals in the Listhogil Tomb at the Carrowmore site and a tomb at Primrose Grange, just over a mile apart in Ireland.Co-first author Dr Federico Sanchez-Quinto, a population-geneticist at Uppsala University, said: 'This came as a surprise.'It appears as these Neolithic societies were tightly knit with very close kin relations across burial sites.'The Ansarve site on the island of Gotland in the Baltic Sea is embedded in an area with mostly hunter-gathers at the time.The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory.It begins with the earliest known use of stone tools by hominins, ancient ancestors to humans, during the Old Stone Age - beginning around 3.3 million years ago.Between roughly 400,000 and 200,000 years ago, the pace of innovation in stone technology began to accelerate very slightly, a period known as the Middle Stone Age.By the beginning of this time, handaxes were made with exquisite craftsmanship. This eventually gave way to smaller, more diverse toolkits, with an emphasis on flake tools rather than larger core tools.The stone age is a period in human prehistory distinguished by the original development of stone tools that covers more than 95 per cent of human technological prehistory. This image shows neolithic jadeitite axes from the Museum of ToulouseThese toolkits were established by at least 285,000 years in some parts of Africa, and by 250,000 to 200,000 years in Europe and parts of western Asia.These toolkits last until at least 50,000 to 28,000 years ago.During the Later Stone Age the pace of innovations rose and thelevel of craftsmanship increased.Groups of Homo sapiens experimented with diverse raw materials, including bone, ivory, and antler, as well as stone.The period, between 50,000 and 39,000 years ago, is also associated with the advent of modern human behaviour in Africa.Different groups sought their own distinct cultural identity and adopted their own ways of making things.Later Stone Age peoples and their technologies spread out of Africa over the next several thousand years.

Batting all-rounder Vijay Shankar on Monday experienced a "dream come true" moment after being named in India's World Cup squad and said he is learning the art of handling pressure in a mega event from IPL teammates like Bhuvneshwar Kumar."I am extremely elated to be in the Indian WC team. This is like a dream come true. We have a few World Cup winning team members here at SunRisers Hyderabad and I have spoken to them to understand what it feels like to play in a WC and then go on to win it. I have learnt a lot from them on the ways to manage pressure at such a large scale event," said Shankar referring to his IPL teammate Bhuvneshwar.Shankar is expected to be used as a floater in the batting order, especially at number 4. With his "three-dimensional qualities", the Tamil Nadu player took the slot which was speculated to go to Ambati Rayudu before his dip in form in the home series against Australia last month.Bhuvneshwar, who will be playing his second World Cup, too was elated."I am extremely happy to be selected for the World Cup, the conducive English conditions will suit my strength and I am looking to make the most of it. Playing for SRH in IPL has given me the right match practice just before the mega tournament like World Cup," he said.SRH team mentor and former India batsman VVS Laxman said Indian selectors have picked a strong squad."The Indian team is a very balanced side and is one of the strong contenders for the title. I have closely monitored Bhuvi and Vijay in the nets while they were on SRH duties.They look in great shape and are raring to perform on a stage like World Cup. I can see these players contributing in team's success in a major way," said Laxman.AdvertisementAdvertisementSportsMore

Hardik Pandya produced a sensational late cameo of 37 not out off just 16 balls as he guided Mumbai Indians to a five-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore in an IPL match in Mumbai on Monday. Chasing 172 for a win, the match was in a balance when he came out in the 16th over but Hardik, who was named in India's World Cup squad on Monday, turned the game on its head, smashing five boundaries and two sixes during his unconquered 16-ball innings on a turning track at the Wankhede Stadium.Mumbai needed 22 runs from the last two overs but Hardik took just six balls to hit the required runs, smashing left-arm spinner Pawan Negi for two boundaries and as many sixes to end the run chase. He finished the game with a single off the last ball of the 19th over as Mumbai reached 172 for 5 in 19 overs.This was Mumbai's fifth win in eight games and they are now at third spot with 10 points, while RCB suffered their seventh defeat in eight matches and the Virat Kohli-led team are languishing at the bottom of the table.Earlier, veteran Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga took four wickets for 31 runs as Mumbai restricted RCB to 171 for 7. Mumbai were off to a flying start in their run chase with openers Rohit Sharma (28) and Quinton de Kock (40) finding the boundaries with ease.De Kock took 16 runs from the third over bowled by Umesh Yadav, smashing two boundaries and a six while captain Rohit was elegant as ever, hitting a four and a six off Mohammed Siraj the next over.Mumbai were wallopping at 67 for no loss at the end of first powerplay overs but suddenly off-spinner Moeen Ali (2/28) brought RCB back into the match with a two-wicket burst in a single over.The Englishman removed the two set openers Rohit and de Kock in the space of four deliveries in the eighth over. Rohit was done in a by a delivery which turned viciously from the offside while de Kock was plumbed in front as he was beaten by a delivery which skidded instead of turning and Mumbai were 71 for 2 in 7.4 overs.Ishan Kishan (21) came out and nonchalantly smashed two sixes off Negi before he fell to Yuzvendra Chahal (2/27), stumped by Parthiv Patel.The Mumbai run chase started stuttering and with the pitch turning, Suryakumar Yadav (29) and Krunal Pandya (11) was finding it difficult to get the boundaries. Play was held up for a few minutes in the 13th over with Chahal seemingly having some problem on his little finger but he returned to bowl his fourth over and had the wicket of Suryakumar who holed out to Navdeep Saini near the boundary.Hardik was nearly out in the 17th over but it was his elder brother Krunal who was out in the next over off the bowling of Mohammed Siraj. It was then left to Hardik to take Mumbai to victory in a dramatic fashion. Earlier, AB de Villiers and Moeen Ali hit impressive half centuries to guide Royal Challengers Bangalore to a respectable 171 for 7 after being put into bat.After RCB lost skipper Virat Kohli (8 off 9 balls) and Parthiv Patel (28 off 20 balls) inside seven overs, de Villiers (75 in 51 balls) along with Ali (50 runs in 32 balls) resurrected the innings with a 95-run stand for the third wicket.The South African star stamped his authority, hammering six fours and four sixes, as he completed his half-century in 41 balls. Ali was a little bit more aggressive than De Villiers as he hit five sixes and a lone boundary as the two took the MI attack to cleaners.Ali initially played second fiddle but later upped the ante. He was particularly severe on Australian pacer Jason Behrendorff (1/49), whom he hit for two sixes and a four in the 16th over, which fetched 17 runs for RCB. De Villiers, who took time to settle, then showed his class, as he hit round the park.However, veteran Sri Lankan pacer Lasith Malinga (4/31) pegged the visiting side back by removing Ali and Marcus Stonis (0) in the 18th over and taking two wickets in the final over. De Villiers was run out in the final over off a brilliant throw from long-on.AdvertisementAdvertisementSportsMoreWWE legend Mickie James has revealed she wants to become the Monday Night Milf if she keeps her place on Raw.She will have to make it through the first-ever Superstar Shake-up, a series of trades within the Raw and Smackdown brands.It kicks off tonight, and potentially every wrestler on the WWEs roster could be involved.Mickie, 39, tweeted: So if I stay on WWE Monday Night RawI mean..can we get Monday Night Milf over or naw?!Maybe a t-shirt?!

'We have shovels, picks, rods and we will not get tired because there are still more treasures to find.'The group gathered on Saturday at 8am local time at the Sonora prosecutor's' office before embarking on the search.Mara Teresa Valadez (center) leads the team of searchers that have been trying to locate the bodies of their missing friends and family members sine 2017On Sunday, the government of the north-central state of Guanajuato said that state or local police will accompany Red Cross ambulances 'on the high risk or high-impact calls.' That would presumably be calls related to gunshot victims.A day prior, a man wounded by gunfire was abducted by gunmen from a Red Cross ambulance in the city of Salamanca, which has been plagued by violence between fuel theft gangs due to its gasoline refinery.The Guanajuato state chapter of the first-aid group shuttered operations in the city of 270,000 but later resumed ambulance service.In a statement, the Mexican Red Cross said it 'is an impartial and neutral institution before all conflicts and its purpose is to relieve human suffering,' adding the '#We are not part of the conflict' hashtag.Violence in Mexico has worsened in the last year, with homicides running at their highest rate on record and surpassing the previous peak set in 2011.Earlier this month, a woman with gunshot wounds was executed inside an ambulance in Mexico's Pacific state of Guerrero, while paramedics were reportedly beaten up.The archdiocese of the central state of Puebla said in a recent statement that Rev. Ambroso Arellano Espinoza, a 78-year-old priest, was apparently tortured during a robbery attempt. It said he had been found with severe burns on his hands and feet, but was at a hospital in stable but serious condition.Clandestine burial sites have often been used by drug cartels in Mexico to hide the bodies of executed rivals or kidnap victims.While hundreds of such sites date back to the height of the drug war from 2010 to 2016, some are more recent.Searchers in Mexico generally count the dead by the number of skulls, but not all heads are always present at the time of burial, suggesting death tolls could be even higher.Volunteer searchers often act on tips about where burial grounds are located and then walk through fields plunging rods into the earth to detect the telltale odor of decomposing bodies.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Associated Press and Dailymail.com Reporter  Published: 12:12 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 16:53 EDT, 15 April 2019   15View  commentsRussia is demanding that the US release a Russian citizen who was convicted of kidnapping for moving her children from Kansas to her country of origin amid divorce proceedings.Bogdana Osipova, who is referred to by her married name of Mobley in court documents, was convicted in Kansas last month of one count of international parental kidnapping and two counts of attempting to extort money.Ospivoa, 38, faces up to 20 years in prison on each extortion count and up to three years on the kidnapping count at her May 20 sentencing hearing.Bogdana Osipova (pictured left and right in her mugshot), 38, was convicted last month of one count of international parental kidnapping and two counts of attempting to extort moneyUS prosecutors said Osipova kidnapped her children (pictured with their mother) by moving them from Kansas to her native RussiaThe Russian Embassy in the US released a statement demanding that Osipova be releasedThe Russian Embassy said in a tweet Friday that US authorities should 'stop their lawless behavior and release the Russian citizen Bogdana Osipova, thus returning the mother to her children.'A Russian court has found that the children should remain in Russia.US prosecutors said Osipova, who emigrated to the US in 2003 and has dual citizenship, left Wichita, Kansas, in April 2014 with one child from her first marriage and another child from a second marriage to Brian Mobley, an Air Force recruiter.She gave birth to a third child soon after returning to Russia.

I am physically shaking ... I feel personally attacked'But Taylor officials said they are standing by their decision.Pence was also recently criticized by Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, who pointed out that the vice president's policies 'discriminate' against gay and lesbian Americans.Buttigieg, who went from virtual unknown to budding political phenomenon in just weeks, has mentioned Pence - the former governor of his home state of Indiana - multiple times in his speeches.In a recent address to an LGBTQ organization the rising Democratic star said his same sex marriage had brought him 'closer to God'.'I don't have a problem with religion, I'm religious too. I have a problem with religion being used as a justification to harm people,' Buttigieg, who if elected would be America's first gay president, told NBC's The Ellen Show.'I'm not interested in feuding with the vice president. But if he wanted to clear this up, he could come out today and say he's changed his mind, that it shouldn't be legal to discriminate against anybody in this country for who they are.'Buttigieg, 37, has been mayor of South Bend, Indiana for seven years, while Pence was governor until joining Donald Trump as number two on the ticket in 2016.Pence and Buttigieg worked together on common-ground issues such as infrastructure but clashed over a 2015 religious freedom bill signed by Pence that Mayor Pete and others warned allowed people to discriminate on religious grounds.Pence pushed back against Buttigieg's recent remarks, telling CNN that 'he said some things that are critical of my Christian faith, and about me personally, and he knows better'.Speaking at the Victory Fund last week, Buttigieg highlighted his own Christian devotion and how it helps guide him.Pence was also recently criticized by Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg, who pointed out that the vice president's policies 'discriminate' against gay and lesbian AmericansAnd Buttigieg, who married his husband in a church service last year, challenged Pence over opposing same-sex marriage.'My marriage to Chasten has made me a better man - and yes Mr Vice President, it has moved me closer to God,' he said.'I can tell you that if me being gay was a choice, it was a choice that was made far, far above my pay grade,' he added.'And that's the thing I wish the Mike Pences of the world would understand. That if you got a problem with who I am, your problem is not with me; your quarrel, sir, is with my creator.'The debate has cast the campaign spotlight on faith, as Democrats challenge the stranglehold that fundamentalist conservatives have on what it means to be Christian, especially in the Trump era.Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupBy Chris Spargo For Dailymail.com   Published: 16:09 EDT, 15 April 2019  |  Updated: 18:13 EDT, 15 April 2019   28View  commentsThe Jupiter Police Department and Palm Beach County State Attorney's office are being sued by a man who visited Orchids of Asia Day Spa while the facility was under surveillance by authorities.A complaint filed in federal court on Monday by attorneys Edward Mullins of Reed Smith and Joe Tacopania of The Law Offices of Tacopina & Seigel on behalf of a John Doe, accuses authorities of violating Doe's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process, and constitutional right to privacy.Doe states that he was visiting the spa on January 19 for a massage that did not include any manual or oral sex act from a spa employee.The filing, which was submitted in the United states District Court for the Southern District of Florida, goes on to state that Doe had a reasonable expectation of privacy as he undressed inside the spa and then received a massage while in the nude.He is now seeking monetary, punitive and exemplary damages while demanding that no copy of any of the tapes showing men inside the spa be released to the press or public.Doe also wants those tapes, and any copies, destroyed for good.Patriot:A John Doe has filed a lawsuit against the Town of Jupiter Police, Detective Andrew Sharp and David Aronberg, the Palm Beach County State's Attorney for the sex spa sting that resulted in Robert Kraft (above) being charged with two misdemeanorsHigh voltage:Doe claims that he was filmed both undressing and then nude by police who put hidden cameras in the Orchids of Asia Day Spa (above) on January 19The court filing argues that should those tapes be released, innocent victims like Doe might be exposed due to interest in one of the case's high-profile defendants, billionaire New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft.'On or around January 19, 2019, Mr. Doe entered the Spa and received a massage, while undressed, in a private massage room,' reads the filing.It goes on to state that a licensed therapist provided Doe with this massage.'On information and belief, the Jupiter Police recorded Mr. Doe while undressed and receiving a massage. Mr. Doe did not engage in any sexual or illegal activity at any time while receiving his massage at the Spa,' states the complaint.'Upon information and belief, the Jupiter Police shared these recordings with other individuals and organizations pursuing or acting in parallel with the Investigation, including officers employed by the Jupiter Police, Aronberg and other members of the Palm Beach County States Attorney Office, and, on information and belief, the Martin County Sheriff and the Martin County DA, who were running a related investigation.'The filing then references the interest in the case because of Kraft and how that interest, combined with the realization that Doe had been filmed without his knowledge, has caused the man distress.'The risk of public access demands is particularly acute in the present case, as certainof the defendants charged with misdemeanor solicitation of prostitution include high profile individuals, and the media has already actively sought to obtain the videos collected by the Jupiter Police at the Spa,' writes Tacopania.'There is, therefore, a grave risk that the video will be made public absent immediate court action.'Die has 'suffered invasion ...embarrassment, loss of business opportunities, and substantial expensesincluding legal fees and court costs' reads the complaint.Damages are not the only remedy the man is seeking either, as he asks that officials be ordered ' to permanently and completely destroy, any and all video, audio, photographic, or other recordings, or any images or other records derived from or based on recordings, made inside the Spa.'TMZwas the first to report on this new lawsuit.Detective Andrew Sharp is also named in the lawsuit as a defendant for his actions on the case.'Without probable cause and without a warrant, Sharp requested that an inspector from the Florida Department of Health perform a warrantless search of the Spa. That investigator, Karen Herzog, interviewed each of the employees present in the Spa, and took pictures of their identifications and a fridge and a freezer,' reads the complaint.'Herzog also completed a report indicating that the Spa was not used as a place of domicile.'A lawyer for Kraft did not hold back on the same subject earlier this month, going after the Martin Circuity Sheriff's Office after it was revealed no human trafficking charges would be filed in the spa bust.'Sheriff Will Snyder admitted that there was no human trafficking,' said attorney William Burck.'He lied about it. His officers lied about it. I dont really know what to say. Ive never seen anything quite like that before.'Authorities had initially obtained warrants to install hidden cameras after a health inspector noted evidence that suggested women were living at the spa during a visit to one of the establishments.Sheriff Snyder then had to back off that claim, despite firmly stating that Kraft and the other men accused of soliciting were engaging ins ex acts with trafficked women.'They are supposed to be upholding the law. They are supposed to be officers of justice, but instead he's concocting false allegations against people in order to further headlines rather than justice,' said Burck.'Sheriff Snyder said "the monsters are the men." Sheriff Snyder is the liar.'Published by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media GroupGetty ImageFans often try to sell some wild artist memorabilia but perhaps no wilder item has appeared for sale in recent memory than Childish Gambinos discarded blunt from Coachella.

Before the weekend was up, the half-smoked butt of the blunt had its own listing on Ebay, with the poster pushing for a whopping $1000 price tag.

First of all, selling drugs online is a federal offense, so theres that. But the poster at least made sure to do their research, describing the item in detail: The blunt that Childish Gambino passed to a fan wearing a green shirt! reads the description section. Since the whole performance streamed live on Coachellas Youtube, its pretty unlikely that whomever that fan was is really the poster or that the posted blunt in question is the same blunt from the performance, but hey, theres a sucker born every minute. Fortunately for all the suckers out there, Ebay took down the posting before anyone could get scammed.Of course, some lucky fans did walk away with some pretty nifty souvenirs.

But a post-mortum revealed her injuries were much more severe than that, and consistant with a traumaThe Channel 4 programme, which airs tonight, follows the investigation into the murder of Butiene, 48, who was killed at her home in Wisbech in April 2017.Cambridgeshire's major crime unit launched an investigation into her death after a pathologist raised concerns around the circumstances.Police were called at 8.30pm by three men in a flat in Orange Grove, Wisbech, who said that Butiene, 48, had been drinking, fallen over and died.But suspicions were raised by the ambulance service who said that it appeared Butiene had died a while before the phone call was made.CCTV and witness evidence showed that Bauzys had visited a corner shop half an hour before he placed the call to the emergency services but that he revealed his girlfriend was already deadWhen police arrived at the flat, it appeared she had been dead for a longer period of time, with injuries to her face and chest consistent with somebody kneeing or standing on it.The three men who were in the flat stumbled around, seemingly finding it hard to answer police questions, with Bauzys wondering in and out of the room where the body of his girlfriend of four years was.When DS Graham McMillan, who has dealt with over 200 murders during his career, is sent photos of the dead woman, they immediately raise suspicions.He says: You do get a hunch just through experience, something isnt right... Ive looked at the photos that were taken of the lady in situ and what concerns me, is some of the bruising around the chest and the neck area.Dzilva Butiene, 48, had been with her boyfriend for four years. He was later found guilty of her murderAnd later, the post mortem showed that the woman had died as a result of a trauma to the abdomen that caused her liver to lacerate in two places.Police said the injury was consistent 'with an assault, fall from a first floor building or high speed collision where a victim wasn't wearing a seatbelt'.A man hunt was launched for Butiene's boyfriend of four years, who had turned off his mobile phone and appeared to be in hiding. He wasfound sleeping in a tent in the woods outside of Wisbech.Enquiries by the unit revealed Bauzys had visited a nearby shop about 30 minutes before the ambulance was called.Police discovered Bauzys sleeping in a tent in the woods outside Wisbech, where he was arrested for his girlfriend's murderButiene had moved from Lithuiana to be with her boyfriend, but was about to return to the country for treatment for her alcoholismCCTV showed Bauzys entering a corner shop, and speaking to a shop assistant.When the shop assistant was called in by police, he told how the Lithuanian was 'absolutely white, transparent.'He went on that while he was paying: 'He said to me, he thinks his wife, something might have happened because she doesn't move.He revealed that Bauzys had told him: '"She might be dead". So I asked him so what, doesn't she breathe?'Police investigating the crime were puzzled by the post-mortem, which revealed a traumatic injury to Butiene's stomach which was inconsistent with her boyfriend's version of events'And then he said, "I don't know I checked her pulse". I just told him, he's got to call an ambulance if he thinks so.'Then he bought some alcohol and he left the shop.'It was half an hour later that Bauzys called an ambulance and told emergency services that his partner had fallen and was dying.In interviews Bauzys claimed Butiene had died as a result of a fall and that he was not responsible for her death.DI Alan Page called it 'a horrendous case of domestic abuse behind closed doors' and said 'thankfullythe medical evidence showed her injuries were consistent with an assault, fall from a first floor building or high speed collision where a victim wasn't wearing a seatbelt'One detective questioning the Lithuianian asked him:'Do you understand how horrific this is that you would leave her dying in the flat while you went to buy alcohol?'And police later discovered more evidence which seemed to suggest that she was a domestic violence victim.They found X-rays hidden on a CD-Rom which showed she'd had several broken ribs months earlier.Bauzys was later charged with her murder and in October 2017 he was found guilty of murder at Cambridge Crown Court and was sentenced to life, to serve a minimum of 17 and a half years. Kestutis Bauzys, 48, was found guilty of the murder of his long-term girlfriend at Cambridge Crown Court on 17 October 2017 following a three week trial.Dzilva Butiene, 48, was staying with boyfriend-of-four-years, Bauzys, in Debnam Court, Orange Grove, Wisbech on 5 April 2017 when she was murdered.The ambulance service raised their concerns with police after discovering Mrs Butiene had died some time before they were called at 8.30pm and had fresh bruises on her lip and other bruises to her face and arms.Bauzys consistently told paramedics the injuries were caused because the mother-of-two was an alcoholic and had fallen.Further investigation revealed Bauzys had visited a nearby shop at about 8pm to buy alcohol and when paying mentioned to the shop assistant that his wife was not breathing.He also spoke to a member of the public and asked her to call an ambulance but the woman didn't speak English and called her son to help.A post mortem carried out by Dr Nat Cary concluded Mrs Butiene died of a trauma to the abdomen that had caused a laceration to her liver in two places.Bauzys was arrested after he was found sleeping in a tent in woods just outside Wisbech on the A47 on 13 April.Detective Inspector Alan Page, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Major Crime Unit, said: 'This was a horrendous case of domestic abuse behind closed doors. Bauzys consistently lied claiming Mrs Butiene had caused her injuries herself from falling over.'The expert medical evidence stated that these type of injuries would be seen either from a forceful assault, a fall from a first floor building or a high speed road collision where the victim wasn't wearing a seatbelt.'We established that Mrs Butiene had not left the flat and that Bauzys had been the only person in her company at the time she would have received the fatal injury.'In this case officers had not received any previous reports of domestic abuse. We would urge anyone who finds themselves in an abusive relationship, please find the courage to tell someone. You don't have to come direct to police but it's not acceptable to live with abuse.'In a statement Mrs Butiene's family said: 'Dzilva's death has left utter devastation to all her friends and family here in Lithuania, including her two sons. We have all been affected by her death and remain to take each day at a time.'Bauzys was sentenced to life in prison in 2017, and a minimum of 17-and-a-half years.Source: Cambrideshire policePublished by Associated Newspapers LtdPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group
